  <p>With WatchOS 3.2 it looks like Apple are introducing “Theatre Mode” to the Apple Watch. What this is, is basically a mode to put your watch on while at the cinema to mute notifications and avoid waking the screen automatically. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> There has been plenty of reports to suggest that Theatre Mode will be introduced on iOS this year too.</p>

<p>While it’s definitely a nice feature, even if a little bit niche <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, I hope that it isn’t Apples only attempt at a dark mode this year. I’ve long been anticipating a system wide dark mode on iOS, and Theatre Mode seems like a logical step towards it.</p>

<p>I don’t expect dark mode to show up in any of the iOS 10.3 builds over the next few weeks. If it’s to be introduced this year it will presumably be with iOS 11.</p>

<p>What I think would be great would be to have the option to automatically enable dark mode at certain times of the day, similar to how you can enable <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-ios-9-3-night-shift-mode/">Night Shift</a> between certain times, or for it to be able to detect the level of light that you have and enable/disable based on that.</p>

      <p>9to5mac have published a good <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/01/30/watchos-3-2-beta-1-theater-mode-video/">overview</a> of Theatre Mode on WatchOS with an accompanying video. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>And does it really warrant a place in Control Center? Surely this year will finally be the year that Apple allows us to customize the setting available to toggle in Control Center. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>Manton Reece is creating an interesting new social network based around blogging and owning your own content called “Micro.blog”. The idea is fairly simple - you can host your own blog right on Micro.blog, or you can simply use your RSS feed as an input, therefore keeping total control of your content.</p>

<p>The great thing about this is that it can bring you a new audience and allow you to join conversations about other blogs all in one place. It’s like an RSS reader with social integration.</p>

<p>A big problem with social media is that you never truly own your content. Most services allow you to export your data at any time, so that in the event that the  platform shuts down you can hold onto your content. The great thing about Micro.blog is that you never have to give up any of your content in the first place, whether or not it lasts as a platform.</p>

<p>Judging by the support on the Micro.blog <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing">Kickstarter page</a>, we could be seeing it sooner rather than later.</p>

  <p>Rory McIlroy on Tiger Woods:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m drawn to him, yeah. He’s an intriguing character because you could spend two hours in his company and see four different sides to him. When he’s comfortable and he trusts you — and his trust (sensitivity) is way (higher) than mine — he’s great. He’s thoughtful. He’s smart. He reads. He can’t sleep so that’s all he does — he reads stuff and educates himself on everything. But he struggles to sleep, which I think is an effect of overtraining, so I tell him to calm down sometimes. He’d be texting me at four o’clock in the morning: ‘Up lifting. What are you doing?’</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>Nice roundup of the uses and benefits of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/3d-touch/">3D Touch</a> on iPhone. I use it constantly on my phone, mostly for quick multitasking and peeking at URLs. Definitely one of the best interactions on iOS in my opinion, I just hope more developers make use of it in the coming year.</p>

  <p>Federico Viticci just posted his annual “must have iOS apps” article on Macstories detailing his favourite apps in certain categories. I <a href="http://colm.io/2015/12/22/must-have-ios-apps-2015-edition/">wrote about</a> last years article and compared which apps also feel into my list of favourites. So more of the same:</p>

<p><a id="dropbox"></a></p>

<h4 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h4>
<p>I wouldn’t go as far as to say this is one of my favourite apps, but Dropbox is an essential service for online storage, and still my favourite of the lot. Google Drive comes in at a close second, but so far nothing can beat Dropbox to the top. The app is simple, yet stable and receives regular updates.</p>

<p><a id="1password"></a></p>

<h4 id="password">1Password</h4>
<p>I said last year that I would be lost without 1Password, and nothing has changed this year. I still add new passwords to it regularly. The app is one of the most actively updated in this list as well, which is a bit crazy seeing as what it does is relatively simple. I can’t recommend it enough.</p>

<p><a id="workflow"></a></p>

<h4 id="workflow">Workflow</h4>
<p>I only recently downloaded Workflow to try it out, so I’m only scratching the surface of what it’s capable of, but what an application it is. Something as simple as opening your current location in a Google Street View image in a single tap, or adding a reminder from the widgets screen are built right into Workflow. It even has its own Workflow Store where people can submit Workflows that they created and others can download them. I think it’s the most exciting app to hit iOS since its launch based on the sheer number of possibilities alone. There’s a lot more to discover with it.</p>

<p><a id="telegram"></a></p>

<h4 id="telegram">Telegram</h4>
<p>I only use Telegram to follow updates from the Macstories team, but the app itself deserves a mention for its regular updates with new features. Mobile messaging is a tough market to break into seeing as Whatsapp has all but sown up the market share, but Telegram is in my opinion a better app and includes some unique features.</p>

<p><a id="whatsapp"></a></p>

<h4 id="whatsapp">Whatsapp</h4>
<p>I don’t really have much to say here other than I use Whatsapp multiple times every day, and I have had zero problems with it. I don’t think you can ask much more from a messaging app. Telegram has shown that a messaging app can still shake it up in terms of features, so hopefully Whatsapp can continue to improve and add more features in the coming year.</p>

<p><a id="youtube"></a></p>

<h4 id="youtube">YouTube</h4>
<p>Another app that I use daily, the only complaint I have about it is that it still hasn’t got picture-in-picture on iPad. Support for Split View has eased the pain..for now.</p>

<p><a id="overcast"></a></p>

<h4 id="overcast">Overcast</h4>
<p>Overcast is still my podcast player of choice becuase of Smart Speed and Voice Boost. Once you get used to those features it’s very hard to go back to any other player. Dark mode is <a href="https://marco.org/2016/09/09/overcast-ads">now free</a> also, which is a big bonus.</p>

<p><a id="googlemaps"></a></p>

<h4 id="google-maps">Google Maps</h4>
<p>Google Maps is still the best map application on iOS. <a href="http://www.imore.com/whats-new-maps-app-ios-10">Improvements</a> to Apple Maps have been encouraging, but there’s still a long way to go for Apple to match Google here, although the gap is narrowing.</p>
