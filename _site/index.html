  <p>As expected, Apple announced their latest updates to the Mac line in yesterdays “Hello Again” event. I didn’t watch the event myself, but I caught up with people’s opinions on the announcements this morning. Some of the highlights:</p>

<p><a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/10/27/new-macbook-pros-and-the-state-of-the-mac/">Michael Tsai</a> was dissapointed with the announcments:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The new MacBook Pro has a premium price for a Mac that’s still limited to 16 GB of RAM, has CPU performance that is likely lackluster because Apple didn’t talk about it in the keynote, and apparently doesn’t have such a great GPU, either. Apple prioritized thinness and lightness, which I care about hardly at all. I would rather have better performance, a good keyboard, more storage, a larger display, more ports so I don’t have to carry dongles, an SD card slot, etc. Double the weight and half the battery life would be fine with me. I’m not saying Apple shouldn’t make thin and light notebooks, but why do they all have to be that way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/10/the-mac-line-is-still-kinda-broken/">Stephen Hackett</a> liked the new Touch Bar, but pointed out that Apple still haven’t addressed their full lineup - most notably their desktops:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The notebook line is pretty confusing right now. There are several machines — ahem, MacBook Air — that seem to exist to hit a price point. I understand and respect that, but I am already dreading offering buying advice over the next year.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But there’s a bigger problem. Apple may have fixed what was wrong with its notebook line, but the Mac is still broken. Just look at the MacRumors Buyer’s Guide:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marco Arment mentioned the elephant in the room - price:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The substantial price increases are putting a big damper on these announcements for a lot of people.</p>&mdash; Marco Arment (@marcoarment) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/791720032753557506">October 27, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Genarally speaking, these are some good updates to the MacBook line. The new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/macos/touch-bar/">Touch Bar</a> looks like a great way to add an extra user input option in a less clumsy way than a touch screen, and they are thinner, lighter and faster than ever before.</p>

<p>But all that aside, there’s no getting away from the price. The <em>cheapest</em> MacBook Pro with the new Touch Bar is €2099. <strong>TWO THOUSAND AND NINETY NINE EURO</strong> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Macs were never cheap, but I think at this price point, Apple has raised the bar to a price point that just can’t be justified by many people, myself included. This is the exact opposite of what the Mac needs right now, and obviously won’t help their <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/10/apples-fiscal-4th-quarter-in-5-charts/">struggling</a> mac sales.</p>

<p>The Mac already seems like it’s a bit of an afterthought at Apple. Spending that sort of money on a product that most likely won’t see a meaningful update for a long time seems like a bad move. I won’t be abandoning my ‘<a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/1/4/non-retina-macbook-pro-still-sells">101</a>’ any time soon.</p>

      <p>And that’s just a 13 inch base model. If you want a 15 inch Pro you’re paying dangerously close to the €3000 mark for the <em>base</em> model. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>I’m terrible when it comes to design and fashion, or anything even remotely related to them. So when it comes to making changes around those areas, I am a little…uneasy.</p>

<p>I recently made slight changes to the appearance of the blog. This is something I imagine I will do fairly regularly as it evolves, until I’m happy with a particular design <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. The main change I wanted to try out was a darker background. I’m a big fan of dark themes in software applications. They are easier on the eye, and in my opinion they just <em>look</em> better. For that reason, I wanted to try out a dark background. It may not be to everyones taste but I wanted to see if it holds up after a couple of weeks of use.</p>

<p>I recently came across an article by Matt Gemmell from a few years back entitled “<a href="http://mattgemmell.com/designing-blogs-for-readers/">Designing blogs for readers</a>”. In it, he details how the design of his own blog has evolved through the previous decade(!), starting out with a cluttered design full of every possible widget known to man, and eventually working it’s way to a simple design with the reader in mind. He then goes on to document his own set of guidlelines for blog readibility. Of those, I violate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Date-based index pages</li>
  <li>A feed button</li>
  <li>Background textures or colours</li>
</ul>

<p>These are relatively minor things, and I’m not too bothered about them. I like date indices. I’m in the (presumable) minority in the fact that I regularly use date indexes when visiting blogs that have them. The RSS button on my header is hardly neccesary, but again is pretty useful to have available on each page <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. As discussed above, I like darker themes, so having a background colour to me is often seen as a good thing.</p>

<p>Matt definitely has some great points in his post, but it’s ok to put your own stamp on what is essentially <em>your</em> website.</p>

<p>There is still plenty of things that I would like to try out on the site, such as footers, linked lists, recent posts, a logo, more experimentation with blogging engines and publishing with Apple News. That’s more than enough to keep me busy. I may end up linking this post sometime in the future to show how right or wrong I was, or how lazy I am for not following up.</p>

      <p>In the future I may consider adding a footer to the site, which is where I would probably add the RSS link. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>David Smith:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Four years ago today I introduced a weather app called Check the Weather. I was really proud of how it turned out. It was my first app where I was able to do everything ‘right’ from the beginning. It was localized, had solid VoiceOver support and had an actual marketing plan to get it off the ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sadly, however, the time has come to discontinue support for the app. The cost of providing weather data to it has grown too large to sustain. It has been operating at a slight loss for the last 2 years, which I didn’t mind providing as I used the app myself. However, a recent change in the pricing for my radar data provider has made it infeasible to continue providing weather data for the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Check the Weather has been my go to weather app for the past few years. It’s a shame to see it go.</p>

  <p>Stephen Hackett:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I understand Apple wanting to make sure that Siri’s core functionality of controlling your iOS device keeps getting better. That stuff should be bulletproof, but we’re five years into Siri’s life. The company should be moving past these features and making Siri smarter about the world around us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve long since given up on using Siri for anything more than questions like “When are Manchester United playing next?” or “What will the weather be like today?”. I don’t find it very useful for anything more than that. Siri has a long way to go to get close to the Amazon Echo or Google Assistant. Five years into its life, it still lacks the ability to understand some reasonably simple tasks:</p>

  <p>I enjoyed this review of the iPhone 7 on MacStories, particluarly the section on the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/09/12/apple-w1-chip-how-it-works/">W1 chip</a>. The iPhone 7 has brought about <a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/8/26/adios-headphone-jack">changes</a> that we may not be in a perfect position to take advantage of just yet, but in the near future will become the norm. Federico Viticci hit the nail on the head with his closing paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But using the iPhone 7 also made me appreciate the meaning of changes that will reshape the iPhone platform going forward – something that’s more significant than endlessly debating what we left behind.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iPhone 7 is a bold step towards a future we can start understanding today.</p>
