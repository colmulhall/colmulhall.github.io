	<p>Chris Sauvé on why footnotes on the web are a pain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Footnotes on the web are a pain in the ass. You click on a tiny number, get transported somewhere near the bottom of the page, find the footnote you were looking for, and click on a link to go back to where you were on the page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris created a solution to this problem in the form of a jQuery plugin called <a href="http://bigfootjs.com/">bigfoot</a>. Bigfoot allows you to click on a footnote and instead of getting pushed down to your footnote at the bottom of the page, you get a nice little pop up. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I decided to implement these as part of <a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/04/04/what-needs-fixing">a todo list</a> which I am still working my way through. I’m not a heavy footnote user, but I’ve seen bigfoot used on enough websites now to know that I don’t want to go back to traditional footnotes.</p>

<p>Camel, the engine which powers this blog, already supports footnotes thanks to <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2015/1/15/camel-changes">this</a> update last year. Luckily it’s fairly easy to implement bigfoot on top of this. The first step is to download the project from the <a href="http://bigfootjs.com/">website</a> into your Camel file system. Although they can be put together into one file I chose to separate the bigfoot CSS from my site CSS <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/colmulhall/9f96de794d25282ee51651026a24699f.js"></script>

<p>Next, I downloaded jQuery from the <a href="http://jquery.com/download/">official website</a>. Once it was downloaded I added it to my file system in a ‘js’ folder, along with the bigfoot resources. The last thing you need to do is add the following anywhere on the page to enable bigfoot:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/colmulhall/793a9eb42dcf426907d1140432bbc797.js"></script>

<p>In order for bigfoot to work, you need to make sure that footnotes resemble something like this in your code:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/colmulhall/7e062bde8fd570488d6a4fce9a862fba.js"></script>

<p>Luckily, Camel supports MultiMarkdown which displays footnotes like this. But if you are using a different engine/CMS this may be done differently.</p>

<p>I had to do a <em>lot</em> of tweaking of the CSS to make the footnotes look how I wanted. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Funnily enough that is what took me the longest to figure out, and it still isn’t perfect (CSS gradients are confusing). It’s also worth noting that there are several bigfoot <a href="http://bigfootjs.com/#options">options</a> available to you, each of which are detailed on the website. I wanted to retain the footnotes with anchor links as the bottom of my posts. To do this you can use the actionOriginalFN: “ignore” option. This does exactly what you would think in that it ignores any original footnote markup. This can be added to the bigfoot script tag:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/colmulhall/25d269afa815cf0fc5a291638d7ab658.js"></script>

<p>And that’s it! This was an interesting exercise to undertake and I think it makes a big difference to the browsing experience on the website. I may revisit the CSS of the footnotes at a later stage but for now I am happy.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Like this! <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>I changed the name of ‘bigfoot-default.css’ to ‘bigfoot.css’. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>Like a lot of things on this site, they are heavily influenced by <a href="https://marco.org/">Marco.org</a>. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
