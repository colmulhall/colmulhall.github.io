	<p>Now that the dust has settled on the announcements, I want to give my opinion on what we saw today. There was a lot packed into the hour long event, so Iâ€™ll just mention what I found most interesting - the product announcements.</p>

<h4 id="iphone-se">iPhone SE</h4>

<p>A lot of people still buy 4-inch iPhones so itâ€™s nice to see Apple recognising this. For the last two years, people who wanted a smaller iPhone had to settle for the â€˜cheapâ€™ model with older internals. The iPhone SE is very much a current generation smartphone, with internals comparable to the flagship 6s. This makes it a real option for people looking for a something more than just a cheap option, and as mentioned in the event it will probably become a popular option for people who are new to iOS. Going for the cheap option has previously come with a big asterisk in terms or performance and shelf life. For the first time in a long time there is now a solid line of iPhones which I wouldnâ€™t hesitate in recommending to someone new to the platform.</p>

<p>While I like the design, I do find it strange that it is basically an exact copy of the iPhone 5s (which was released as far back as 2013). I expected it to look like a 6/6s except in a smaller form factor. This probably wonâ€™t put people off, but itâ€™s still a strange move. It might be that itâ€™s cheaper to manufacture with that design.</p>

<p>Jason Snell of Six Colors <a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/712047903154577408">posted</a> this picture after the event. The SE (on the right) and the 5s are basically identical:</p>

<h4 id="ipad-pro-97-inch">iPad Pro 9.7-inch</h4>

<p>This was what I was most excited about, and I wasnâ€™t let down. The new iPad Pro is packed with some great features and is a real solid update to the 9.7-inch line.</p>

<p>Coming in at just under a pound, this iPad retains its portable size which packing in â€˜proâ€™ features. In fact itâ€™s got all of the features of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, along with some of its own. A better 12-megapixel camera capable of 4K video recording (complete with camera bump ðŸ™„), a 5-megapixel FaceTime camera and â€˜True Toneâ€™ display, which adjusts white balance to match the light around you. In other words, makes the display a whole lot better in outside conditions. These updates make it significantly better than the 12.9-inch version, so itâ€™s good to see that we didnâ€™t just get a shrunken iPad Pro.</p>

<p>The pricing also reflects the Pro marketing. Starting at â‚¬699 for a 32Gb all the way up to â‚¬1059 for a 256Gb version (256!), this is not a cheap device..not that Apple products are known for their budget prices. However this has to be seen as more of a computer than a tablet. It will replace laptops for a lot of people, and Iâ€™m guessing iOS 10 will only further strengthen that argument. I think 32Gb will very quickly become the new <a href="https://david-smith.org/blog/2015/09/10/16gb-is-a-bad-user-experience/">16Gb</a>, so I donâ€™t think that would be a good buy for most people.</p>

<p>The iPad Air 2 has dropped by â‚¬100. Thatâ€™s not bad for a device which is still very capable despite marching towards being two years old. Itâ€™s still a very good media consumption device.</p>

<h4 id="the-rest">The Rest</h4>

<p>As well as adding some new band options, the Apple Watch Sport Edition was dropped by â‚¬100. This seems good on the surface, but thereâ€™s no getting away from the fact the what the Apple Watch really needs is <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/02/why-slowness-is-killing-the-apple-watch/">new hardware</a>. I think itâ€™s probably a bad time to buy one, as Apple will probably release new hardware later in the year.</p>

<p>iOS 9.3 was also released this evening. Turns out Night Shift is pretty useful, but takes a bit of getting used to. I talked in more detail about 9.3 <a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/1/15/ios-9-3">here</a>.</p>

<p>These days pretty much everything about these events get leaked beforehand so it was nice to see that there were a few surprises here, and some genuinely great products.</p>
