	<p>Federico Viticci just posted his annual “must have iOS apps” article on Macstories detailing his favourite apps in certain categories. I <a href="http://colm.io/2015/12/22/must-have-ios-apps-2015-edition/">wrote about</a> last years article and compared which apps also feel into my list of favourites. So more of the same:</p>

<p><a id="dropbox"></a></p>

<h4 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h4>
<p>I wouldn’t go as far as to say this is one of my favourite apps, but Dropbox is an essential service for online storage, and still my favourite of the lot. Google Drive comes in at a close second, but so far nothing can beat Dropbox to the top. The app is simple, yet stable and receives regular updates.</p>

<p><a id="1password"></a></p>

<h4 id="password">1Password</h4>
<p>I said last year that I would be lost without 1Password, and nothing has changed this year. I still add new passwords to it regularly. The app is one of the most actively updated in this list as well, which is a bit crazy seeing as what it does is relatively simple. I can’t recommend it enough.</p>

<p><a id="workflow"></a></p>

<h4 id="workflow">Workflow</h4>
<p>I only recently downloaded Workflow to try it out, so I’m only scratching the surface of what it’s capable of, but what an application it is. Something as simple as opening your current location in a Google Street View image in a single tap, or adding a reminder from the widgets screen are built right into Workflow. It even has its own Workflow Store where people can submit Workflows that they created and others can download them. I think it’s the most exciting app to hit iOS since its launch based on the sheer number of possibilities alone. There’s a lot more to discover with it.</p>

<p><a id="telegram"></a></p>

<h4 id="telegram">Telegram</h4>
<p>I only use Telegram to follow updates from the Macstories team, but the app itself deserves a mention for its regular updates with new features. Mobile messaging is a tough market to break into seeing as Whatsapp has all but sown up the market share, but Telegram is in my opinion a better app and includes some unique features.</p>

<p><a id="whatsapp"></a></p>

<h4 id="whatsapp">Whatsapp</h4>
<p>I don’t really have much to say here other than I use Whatsapp multiple times every day, and I have had zero problems with it. I don’t think you can ask much more from a messaging app. Telegram has shown that a messaging app can still shake it up in terms of features, so hopefully Whatsapp can continue to improve and add more features in the coming year.</p>

<p><a id="youtube"></a></p>

<h4 id="youtube">YouTube</h4>
<p>Another app that I use daily, the only complaint I have about it is that it still hasn’t got picture-in-picture on iPad. Support for Split View has eased the pain..for now.</p>

<p><a id="overcast"></a></p>

<h4 id="overcast">Overcast</h4>
<p>Overcast is still my podcast player of choice becuase of Smart Speed and Voice Boost. Once you get used to those features it’s very hard to go back to any other player. Dark mode is <a href="https://marco.org/2016/09/09/overcast-ads">now free</a> also, which is a big bonus.</p>

<p><a id="googlemaps"></a></p>

<h4 id="google-maps">Google Maps</h4>
<p>Google Maps is still the best map application on iOS. <a href="http://www.imore.com/whats-new-maps-app-ios-10">Improvements</a> to Apple Maps have been encouraging, but there’s still a long way to go for Apple to match Google here, although the gap is narrowing.</p>
