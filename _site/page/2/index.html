  <blockquote>
  <p>I’m really not sure what else there is to say about Bully. The game, when it was originally released, scored an impressive 87 on Metacritic, and it’s only gotten better over the years with the various visual improvements and minor gameplay additions. If you missed Bully when it was first released on the PlayStation 2, then skipped it again when it was re-released on other platforms, don’t miss this new re-remastered iteration. Hell, I’d say the entirety of the Rockstar iOS catalog is worth owning, and Bully: Anniversary Edition is no different.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Continuing with their tradition of releasing past console classics on mobile around Christmas, usually on the 10 year anniversary of the games, Rockstar are now releasing “Bully” on iOS and Android. I loved this game when I first played it on PS2 (it was known as “Canis Canem Edit” in PAL regions), so I’m expecting much of the same on mobile.</p>

<p>To date, Rockstar have ported:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, 2010</li>
  <li>Grand Theft Auto III, 2011</li>
  <li>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, 2012</li>
  <li>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, 2013</li>
  <li>Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, 2015</li>
</ul>

  <p>I watched the first episode of <del>Top Gear</del> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5712554/">The Grand Tour</a> a few days ago. I’m not going to write a full review of the episode - I’ll leave that to <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2016/11/20/the-holy-trinity">others</a> - but I will summarize my thoughts below:</p>

<h4 id="the-intro-showed-just-how-big-the-budget-is-for-the-show">The intro showed just how big the budget is for the show</h4>
<p>Seriously, just watch the opening sequence.</p>

<h4 id="the-star-in-a-reasonably-priced-car-segment-looks-like-its-gone">The “Star in a reasonably priced car” segment looks like it’s gone</h4>
<p>Adios, you won’t be missed.</p>

<h4 id="the-studio-segments-need-work">The studio segments need work</h4>
<p>I thought some sketches went on for far too long, and the presenters themselves seemed nervous. First episode nerves are to be expected though.</p>

<h4 id="the-tour-is-a-great-idea">The ‘tour’ is a great idea</h4>
<p>New episode, new location, new audience, new tracks, new cars. This almost guarantees that each epiosde will be unique and have it’s own distict feel to it.</p>

<h4 id="chemistry-is-everything">Chemistry is everything</h4>
<p>I watch the show not for the car reviews, but for the presenters themselves. That is something that Top Gear now has a major challenge in replicating.</p>

<p>This vulnerability will surely be fixed by Apple pretty soon. It’s crazy to think about the amount of devices that got these notifications.</p>

  <p>What a ridiculously successful four years Volkwagen had in the World Rally Championship.</p>

<p>The highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>43 wins in 52 rallies</li>
  <li>Topped the Drivers’ and Co-Drivers’ Championship for an uninterrupted 986 days</li>
  <li>Topped Manufacturers’ standings for 1346 days in a row</li>
  <li>Won 12 rallies in a row on <em>two</em> seperate occasions</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a shame to see a team that are so dominant leave the WRC based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">other issues</a> with the company. It will be a real test for Sébastien Ogier next season to retain his title with a different car and team behind him for the first time.</p>

  <p>Matt Gemmell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But there’s also another way. And don’t pretend that you can’t see the writing on the wall. The Mac, and the traditional desktop computing paradigm, is dying. I think Apple wants it to die, rightly so. And most normal people don’t even care. In a generation, they’ll barely remember. That’s a sobering thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a strong feeling about which way the wind is blowing, figuratively speaking, and I’m not going to wait until my hand is forced; I’m jumping now. Because I have the luxury of being able to, and because I think this is what I’ve wanted since before I was a writer, and before I was a software engineer previously, and before I knew how to use a pointing device despite already having ten of them. Since before anyone ever told me I should.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably the best justification of a tablet over a PC that I have read. Matts theory on the fate of PCs over the next few years is a bit depressing, but hard to argue with.</p>
