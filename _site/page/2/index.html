  <p>It’s hard to describe the iPhone 8 as anything other than a minor upgrade. The ‘8’ branding is really just a way for Apple to justify the iPhone X (10) name. I was due an upgrade from my network, so I decided to upgrade from my two year old iPhone 6S to the iPhone 8. After a week of use, below are my thoughts.</p>

<h3 id="the-good">The good</h3>
<p>The <em>glass back</em> is a welcome return. I never had a problem with the aluminium back of the 6S, but the 8 has a much more premium feel to it. It also has more grip than the aluminium. One thing to note is that it does collect fingerprints very easily, or at least the space gray version does.</p>

<p>The usual bump in <em>processor</em> is also welcome. I was glad to see that the 8 got the same A11 processor as the X. What that means to the average user is that apps will open quicker, battery will last longer and the phone will feel a lot more fluid in general use. It provides a noticeable boost over the A9 on my 6S, but shouldn’t be taken as a single reason on it’s own to upgrade - the 6S is still plenty fast.</p>

<p>The <em>camera</em> is also noticeably better, particularly in dealing with high and low light, but as with the processor, you have to go fairly far back in the timeline of iPhone releases to find a bad camera.</p>

<p>The <em>speakers</em> have surprised me. They are considerably louder and produce a much clearer sound than before. I often end up finishing a podcast using the speakers after arriving home from work, and this is no issue now, even if the phone is in another room.</p>

<h3 id="the-not-so-good">The not so good</h3>
<p>One step forward with the speakers, one step back with the <em>headphone jack</em>, or lack thereof. Now, I know I’m a year too late, but there’s no getting around the fact that the removal of the headphone jack is just one big pain in the a***. I’m using the lightning to headphone dongle for both my earphones and the AUX in my car which is everything that you would expect - annoying. It was the one single reason that I was reluctant to upgrade from my 6S. On the balance, I think the positives of the 8 outweigh this negative, but if you plan on upgrading from an iPhone 6S or older, prepare for this annoyance.</p>

<p>The <em>design</em> of the phone is nice but it is starting to look dated. This is give or take the same design of the three year old iPhone 6, which is an eternity in the tech world. It’s fine for now, but as we make our way through the X and beyond, it’s not going to age very well.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>That leads me to my final point about the 8. It’s going to forever be the phone living in the shadow of the <em>iPhone X</em>, but that’s fine. The iPhone 8 is a great phone with a proven design and some great updates. If you can bear to live without a headphone jack, or the absolute latest hardware from Apple, the iPhone 8 is the perfect choice.</p>

  <p>David Sparks on the value of using RSS over social media for news curation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason I’ve stuck with RSS is the way in which I work. Twitter is the social network that I participate in most and yet sometimes days go by where I don’t load the application. I like to work in focused bursts. If I’m deep into writing a book or a legal client project. I basically ignore everything else. I close my mail application, tell my phone service to take my calls, and I definitely don’t open Twitter. When I finish the job, I can then go back to the Internet. I’ll check in on Twitter, but I won’t be able to get my news from it. That only works if you go into Twitter much more frequently than I do. That’s why RSS is such a great solution for me. If a few days go by, I can open RSS and go through my carefully curated list of websites and get caught back up with the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m a <a href="http://colm.io/2015/12/28/discovering-rss/">big fan</a> of RSS, and I agree with Davids point here. Social media sites like Twitter really aren’t designed for following news or blogs aside from just reading headlines. Tweets get buried within seconds, whereas RSS keeps everything waiting for you when you check it.</p>

<p>The simplicity of RSS is what makes it great. It’s perfect for following a small number of websites and keeping away from the clutter of social media.</p>

  <p>Yoni Heisler, at BGR:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s unusual about iOS 11, though, is that it seems to be unusually and exceedingly buggy. While new iOS releases often have a few wrinkles to be ironed out, the problems users are seeing with iOS 11 are more pervasive and troubling than any iOS release in recent memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to agree with what’s being said here. iOS 11 has already gone through three minor releases since the official launch just over a month ago. That in itself is a sign that not all has gone to plan.</p>

<p>Battery issues have been widely reported. My iPhone 6S has never exactly had excellent battery life, but it’s getting slaughtered since updating to iOS 11. I’m seeing all sorts of strange bugs. Unresponsive home screen, apps quitting for no reason, Touch ID needing two takes, Mail stuck refreshing, and today’s bug: the clock has decided to disappear!</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that we <a href="http://colm.io/2017/09/09/leaks/">knew the details</a> of the majority of products that Apple were planning to announce, there is still a <em>lot</em> to talk about from Apple’s September event.</p>

<p>Apple Watch enthusiasts finally got one of their most requested features - cellular data,  Apple TV enthusiasts (or whatever subset of them have a TV capable of driving 4K) got a nice - albeit minor - upgrade, and general Apple enthusiasts got to see the shiny new headquarters ‘Apple Park’.</p>

<p>For me, I was most interested in seeing the new iPhones.</p>

<center>
	<img src="/images/2017/9/new-iphones.png" alt="iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X and iPhone 8" class="image-single" />
	<figcaption>iPhone 8 Plus, X and 8</figcaption>
</center>

<h2 id="iphone-88-plus">iPhone 8/8 Plus</h2>
<p>Confusingly named ‘8’ and ‘8 Plus’ don’t let that fool you into thinking these are anything other than an iPhone ‘7s’ and ‘7s Plus’.</p>

<p>For the first time since the iPhone 4S, the glass back returns and I’m glad it has. Aesthetics aside, this apparantly enables the 8’s to support wireless charging, which is something that I think will be great once it becomes widely supported in restaurants, airports and cars etc.</p>

<p>It’s great to see that the 8’s have got the same chip as the flagship iPhone X, the A11 ‘Bionic’, promising speeds up to 70% faster than the previous generation. The camera has also got it’s usual bump, and True Tone has been added to the display.</p>

<p>The 8’s are both solid updates, even if they’re not the most exciting. Both phones are a great update for owners of iPhone 6s or older..and those who like to keep their phone prices below the thousand mark..</p>

<h2 id="iphone-x">iPhone X</h2>
<p>The iPhone X, pronounced ‘ten’ <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, is Apple’s first attempt at a bezel-less phone. There’s no denying that it looks great. Immediately all other iPhones look old in comparison.</p>

<p>The notch at the top is what most people seem to be focusing on. For whatever reason, Apple decided to leave the notch at the top to accommodate the camera and sensors. They could have taken the option that Samsung took with the Galaxy S8 by having a thin bezel at the top and bottom of the phone where they can put any hardware they need without impacting on the screen. Until I use the phone in hand I can’t really criticize this design, but for now it does seem like a fairly big compromise for the bezel-less design. Unsurprisingly, the home button is also gone.</p>

<p>Just like the 8’s, the X has gotten the usual hardware updates like CPU bump, camera bump and notably an OLED display which should look great on a phone with a screen this big.</p>

<p>The biggest change from a users perspective is probably the removal of Touch ID for Face ID, which again, will need to be tested in person before being judged. I love Touch ID on my 6s and it works quickly an flawlessly every time, so if Face ID doesn’t deliver the same user experience then it’s hard to see any benefit to it.</p>

<p>I’m a bit torn on my opinion of this phone. I like the look of it, and I know that bezel-less is the way forward, but there’s no denying that this phone is a bit of a risk buy for most people. Ridiculous price aside <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, this is a first attempt from Apple with this design so it’s almost guaranteed to have problems. I wouldn’t recommend getting this phone unless you have a lot of money to spare, and are willing to accept compromises for a peek at the ‘future’.</p>

  <p>There hasn’t been an Apple event with leaks this bad for as long as I can remember.</p>

<p>The latest leaks published on 9to5mac have all but confirmed the look, names and functionality of the new iPhones which are due to be announced this coming Tuesday at Apple Park.</p>

<p>What’s most worrying from Apple’s perspective is that the majority of these leaks have come from Apple themselves, with their software being dug into by some talented people. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>You have to admire the perseverance and skill of these guys in how they can dig into the software and paint a picture of what Apple are working on. But on the other hand it’s a shame to have all the excitement taken from the event.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it’s up to Apple to ensure that any pre-release software is as bulletproof as possible, which is easier said than done when you have this level of interest.</p>

<p>From iOS 5 onwards there is an obvious trend - midweek release in the third week of September. Based on that, and the move to Tuesday last year, I will go with <strong>Tuesday, September 12th</strong> as the release date for iOS 11.</p>

<p><em>Update</em> - I was a week off. iOS 11 releases to the public on the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-ios-11-to-launch-on-september-19th/">19th September</a>.</p>

  <p>Apple silently discontinued the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Nano">iPod nano</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Shuffle">iPod shuffle</a> a few days ago. Although not entirely surprising <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> , it’s still worth noting the significance of this.</p>

<p>The nano was, and still is an excellent device. I <a href="http://colm.io/2016/01/18/ipod-nano-first-gen/">still have</a> a first generation one at home which despite being over eleven years old, wouldn’t look out of place today.</p>

<p>The shuffle is interesting in that it was the only music player in Apple’s lineup that was truly great for exercise. Until the Apple Watch fulfills a better role in health and fitness, there really isn’t any device now in the lineup that is portable and light enough to be comfortable to wear while running or in the gym.</p>

<p>The iPod touch hangs on as the last link to the iPod brand - but it’s unlikely to see any more significant updates as it slowly fades into history.</p>

<p>For all the nostalgia and admiration for these devices however, there is no getting away from the fact that the world has long moved on from the notion of syncing music to a device using a computer, and that is really what killed these iPods.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

  <p>Dan Masters:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has always had a rocky relationship with gaming. They have historically paid little attention to gaming — most notably on the Mac. However, post-iPhone they demonstrated an apparent newfound commitment to games by seemingly devoting significant resources and attention to it each year.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, this would turn out to be a mirage, as they iterated very little and hardly encouraged developer adoption — instead taking the “Build it and they’ll come because we’re Apple” approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gaming is an area that Apple have gone backwards in on iOS. In the early days of the App Store, games were more ambitious and increasingly got more in line with console games. Compare that to today, where casual fremium games dominate the top grossing charts, and it’s clear to see that the App Store hasn’t become the thriving gaming platform to rival consoles that would be suggested all those years back.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Center">Game Center</a> is something that I was excited about when it was first released. The idea of having a rival to PSN and Xbox Live was on iOS showed that Apple were serious about iOS as a gaming platform. Save for one update, Game Center never got any real attention from Apple and it has slowly but surely slid into obscurity.</p>

<p>iPhones and iPads have become real computing powerhouses. Imagine what a gaming company could produce if they could justify spending big money on a project for mobile platforms. I hope that the addition of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/arkit/">ARKit</a> which was announced at WWDC, points towards a revival of gaming on iOS.</p>
