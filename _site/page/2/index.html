  <p>Stephen Hackett:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now that the iPhone 7 starts at 32 GB of storage, the constant juggling needed to avoid a full device has been left behind by more users than ever before.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So let’s talk about iCloud storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>5 GB often isn’t enough to back up an iPhone and an iPad, let alone store years worth of family photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the latest <a href="http://www.androidguys.com/2016/10/07/google-photos-allows-for-free-unlimited-photo-and-video-storage-even-for-iphones-and-ipads/">announcement</a> from Google about unlimited storage for photos, the spotlight has shifted towards Apple, and it’s <em>very</em> stingy 5 GB free iCloud storage. Much like the 16 GB issue that has only recently been resolved <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, this needs to be looked at sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>An average user can hit the 5 GB limit very quickly if they actively take photos. This becomes a bigger problem if they have multiple devices. For photos alone even 10 GB may not be enough for a lot of users. Photos are irreplaceable. So many people must have lost memories because of this storage issue.</p>

<p>I like what Google have done here. They recognise the importance of photos, and historically have been generous with cloud storage sizes. If Apple is serious about catching up with Google on cloud services, storage size is an obvious candidate for change. Let’s hope so.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Well, kind of. 32 GB is hardly a crazy increase, but it has bought Apple a year or two of having an acceptable base storage size. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>I listen to podcasts a lot, particularly while driving or walking to/from work. I don’t have a wide enough taste in music to always have something new to to listen to during these times, and I can’t rely on radio to have the shows I want when I want. Podcasts work best for me.</p>

<p>Here are some podcasts I listen to regulary. Most are weekly, others are more sporadic.</p>

<h4 id="accidental-tech-podcast">Accidental Tech Podcast</h4>
<p>The <a href="http:///atp.fm">show</a> is described as “Three nerds discussing tech, Apple, programming, and loosely related matters.” - and I think that tells you all you need to know about it. Add to that <a href="http://www.hypercritical.co">John Siracusa</a>’s typically razer sharp critique style and you got a good mix of entertainment and information.</p>

<h4 id="connected">Connected</h4>
<p>This is fairly similar to ATP, except the views are light on the technical and more on the user side of things. Worth the listen alone for Federico Viticcis (of <a href="http://www.macstories.net">MacStories</a>) insights into iOS. Find it on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected">Relay</a>.</p>

<h4 id="causality">Causality</h4>
<p>John Chidgey analyzes what went right and what went wrong during disasters. He breaks them down in an easy to follow format and comes up with his report card based on his own experience as an engineer. Causality is part of the <a href="http://engineered.network/causality">Engineered</a> network.</p>

<h4 id="monkey-tennis">Monkey Tennis</h4>
<p>One for the Partridge fans. Four fans of Alan Partridge go through each episode of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129690/">I’m Alan Partridge</a>, providing interesting facts and a <em>lot</em> of quotes. Find it <a href="http://www.postpoppodcasts.com/monkey-tennis/">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="dubland">Dubland</h4>
<p>Suzanne Kane and PJ Gallagher provide nearly an hour of entertainment regarding the goings on in Ireland for the previous week. They pick their heros of the week and tell us some strange animal facts. Hosted on <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/user-530592989">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

<h4 id="pod-a-rooney">Pod-a-rooney</h4>
<p>Comedian Joe Rooney <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> interviews people in the entertainment industry about how they got to where they are. Always an interesting listen with plenty of laughs along the way. It’s on <a href="http://castaway.media/podarooney/">Castaway Media</a>.</p>

  <p>Chris Sauvé on why footnotes on the web are a pain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Footnotes on the web are a pain in the ass. You click on a tiny number, get transported somewhere near the bottom of the page, find the footnote you were looking for, and click on a link to go back to where you were on the page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris created a solution to this problem in the form of a jQuery plugin called <a href="http://bigfootjs.com/">bigfoot</a>. Bigfoot allows you to click on a footnote and instead of getting pushed down to your footnote at the bottom of the page, you get a nice little pop up. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I decided to implement these as part of <a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/4/4/what-needs-fixing">a todo list</a> which I am still working my way through. I’m not a heavy footnote user, but I’ve seen bigfoot used on enough websites now to know that I don’t want to go back to traditional footnotes.</p>

<p>Camel, the engine which powers this blog, already supports footnotes thanks to <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2015/1/15/camel-changes">this</a> update last year. Luckily it’s fairly easy to implement bigfoot on top of this. The first step is to download the project from the <a href="http://bigfootjs.com/">website</a> into your Camel file system. Although they can be put together into one file I chose to separate the bigfoot CSS from my site CSS <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="c">&lt;!-- Stylesheets --&gt;</span> 
<span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/css"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"/css/site.css"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/css"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"/css/bigfoot.css"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next, I downloaded jQuery from the <a href="http://jquery.com/download/">official website</a>. Once it was downloaded I added it to my file system in a ‘js’ folder, along with the bigfoot resources. The last thing you need to do is add the following anywhere on the page to enable bigfoot:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="c">&lt;!-- jQuery --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/js/jquery/jquery-2.2.3.min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>

<span class="c">&lt;!-- Bigfoot Footnotes --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/js/bigfoot/dist/bigfoot.min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bigfoot</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In order for bigfoot to work, you need to make sure that footnotes resemble something like this in your code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;sup</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"fnref:1"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"#fn:1"</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"footnote"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>1<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Luckily, Camel supports MultiMarkdown which displays footnotes like this. But if you are using a different engine/CMS this may be done differently.</p>

<p>I had to do a <em>lot</em> of tweaking of the CSS to make the footnotes look how I wanted. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Funnily enough that is what took me the longest to figure out, and it still isn’t perfect (CSS gradients are confusing). It’s also worth noting that there are several bigfoot [options][bgoptions] available to you, each of which are detailed on the website. I wanted to retain the footnotes with anchor links as the bottom of my posts. To do this you can use the actionOriginalFN: “ignore” option. This does exactly what you would think in that it ignores any original footnote markup. This can be added to the bigfoot script tag:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"> <span class="c">&lt;!-- Bigfoot Footnotes --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/js/bigfoot/dist/bigfoot.min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bigfoot</span><span class="p">({</span>
        <span class="na">actionOriginalFN</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"ignore"</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And that’s it! This was an interesting exercise to undertake and I think it makes a big difference to the browsing experience on the website. I may revisit the CSS of the footnotes at a later stage but for now I am happy.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Like this! <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>I changed the name of ‘bigfoot-default.css’ to ‘bigfoot.css’. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:3">
