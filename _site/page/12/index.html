  <p><a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/02/06/matt-leblanc-joins-top-gear">Another</a> surprise announcement from Top Gear! We were expecting just one more new presenter to be announced to complete the trio, but now there’s <em>seven</em> (including The Stig)!</p>

<p>I expected to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabine_Schmitz">Sabine Schmitz</a> in the lineup, and I think she’s a good choice. As a former racing driver herself she knows probably more about performance cars than anyone else in this lineup. Her other <a href="http://www.topgear.com/videos/sabine-schmitz-vs-jeremy-clarkson-part-12-series-6-episode-7">appearances</a> on Top Gear were entertaining and she comes across as a very likeable person.</p>

<p>Eddie Jordan is an instantly recognizable face in Formula One. His knowledge can’t be questioned, but I am not sure how he will fare as a presenter.</p>

<p>As for Chris Harris and Rory Reid, I can honestly say I have never heard of either of them. I can’t imagine that the BBC would hire people randomly for it’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/11/top-gear-bbc-jeremy-clarkson">biggest</a> show, so I’ve no worries about these guys.</p>

<p>One thing is for sure - Top Gear as we know it is gone. The show looks like it will be a completely different breed than it was before. I can’t understand how people are getting so worked up about how they refuse to watch the new show as Clarkson, Hammond and May are not in it. The last two seasons of Top Gear showed that the producers were running out of ideas. It was a definite drop in quality from the previous years.</p>

<p>I think the ‘fracas’ might end up being a good thing for everyone.</p>

  <p>Now that we know that Clarkson, Hammond and May will have a new show on Amazon Prime, I was a lot less worried about who will take over Top Gear.</p>

<figure>
<img src="/images/2016/2/joey-porsche.gif" alt="Joey and his Porsche" />
</figure>

<p>I wasn’t very surprised when news broke that Chris Evans was to be the new host, but news that Matt LeBlanc has joined the team comes as a real surprise.</p>

<p>Having seen him as a guest on Top Gear before it is clear that he is a big petrol head.  And of course we all know him as Joey from Friends. In theory he’s the perfect person to add entertainment to a show which is as much known for it’s car reviews as its humour. What’s not to like?</p>

  <p>Stephen Hackett on Control Center:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With iOS 7, Apple added Today, a section of Notification Center that users can fill with first- and third-party widgets, as well as Control Center, a quick way to get at commonly-used utilities with a flick up from the bottom of the display.
I don’t think this has aged very well, unfortunately, and it’s mostly Control Center’s fault. In addition to it being confusing to have a hidden panel at the top of the screen, having one at the bottom too is a lot to handle for some users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Center_(iOS)">Control Center</a>. I have used it daily since it’s introduction, and if it were to be removed it would make any iOS device frustrating to use. I don’t agree with Stephen that there needs to be a shift in how it is accessed on the device. I like the fact that there is a clear split between Notifications (pull down), and Utilities (pull up).</p>

<p>The only thing I would change is I would allow some more customisation in what utilities can be accessed through Control Center. I never use the calculator widget. I would prefer to be able to turn on a personal hotspot. Better yet, open it up to developers and allow them to build there own widgets. Maybe even some menus could be added that are specific to Control Center, allowing small interactions without opening apps themselves.</p>

<p>There are so many possibilities even in this one little corner of iOS.</p>

  <p>I am very happy with <a href="https://github.com/cliss/camel">Camel</a> having used it for the past two months, but the one thing I was missing was the ability to publish new posts or make edits on the go via mobile devices. I remembered <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2014/10/6/uncomfortable-riding-this-camel">reading</a> about this issue on Casey Liss’s site a while back so I said I would venture back through the archives to see was there any follow up to the problem.</p>

<p>Turns out <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2014/11/19/heroku-adds-dropbox-support">there is</a>!</p>

<p>Heroku can be connected to Dropbox which enables publishing on the go. The steps are easy, as Casey explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My mobile workflow is as follows:
	1.	Open up a text editor that speaks Dropbox and Markdown. For me, that’s Byword
	2.	Add/edit the files that need updating
	3.	Make sure those changes are saved to Dropbox
	4.	Go to the Heroku Dashboard, find the app in question, and open the Code tab
	5.	Add a commit message, and then click/tap Deploy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This also means there is no longer a need to use Git when deploying any changes which is another win. I now have most of the benefits of a more traditional CMS without any of the downsides.</p>

  <p>Interesting round up of the different generations of the iPod nano through the years. The first generation iPod nano was the first Apple device I owned. I got it back in 2006 in a 1Gb form. I remember at the time I couldn’t believe how thin it was and how easy it was to use. It has aged very well. I still use it from time to time, despite the pain of loading songs from iTunes.</p>

  <p>It’s unusual to see an update of this size coming to iOS at this time of the year, but it’s a welcome one. There’s been a lot of talk about Apple moving towards a different release schedule once iOS 10 gets shipped so it’s realistic that we’ll be seeing more of this kind of thing in the future.</p>

<p>The highlights of 9.3:</p>

<h4 id="night-shift">Night Shift</h4>
<center>
	<img src="/images/2016/1/night-shift.png" alt="Night Shift" />
</center>

<p>This is Apple’s attempt at creating (or copying) a screen brightness ..adjuster. Night Shift automatically changes the shade of your screen late in the evening to a warmer shade which is easier on the eyes and apparently improves sleep. The interesting thing is Apple <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/11/12/flux-iphone-sideloading-shut-down/">wouldn’t allow</a> Flux onto the App Store back late last year. Flux has been around for a long time and offers pretty much the exact same service that Night Shift does. This could be coincidental, or Apple could have had a panic moment and decided to implement their own version. My guess is that it was long in the pipeline. Either way it’s a welcome addition.</p>

<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>Notes has got a nice little update. You can now lock specific notes with a passcode or with Touch ID. I can think of a few scenarios where I would like to use this. I would like to see more of this though. Maybe the ability to lock message conversations or photo albums?</p>

<h4 id="all-the-rest">All The Rest</h4>
<ul>
  <li>News got an update, but we still don’t have it in Ireland.</li>
  <li>The Heath dashboard got an update. Looks nice, but I still haven’t found much use for the app itself.</li>
  <li>Maps in CarPlay got a nice update.</li>
  <li>Some education features were added.</li>
</ul>
