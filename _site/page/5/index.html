  <p>When Apple brought out support for third party keyboards in iOS 8, I tried out several of them, such as <a href="http://www.swype.com/product-features/ios/features.html">Swype</a> and <a href="https://swiftkey.com/en/keyboard/ios">SwiftKey</a>. None of these came close to the ever-reliable stock iOS keyboard. So when Google <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.ie/2016/05/gboard-search-gifs-emojis-keyboard.html">announced</a> their new iOS keyboard ‘Gboard’, I didn’t have high hopes. Not for the first time however, Google have answered the call and surprised me with their take on how a keyboard should work.</p>

<h3 id="the-stock-ios-keyboard">The stock iOS keyboard</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="/images/2016/9/stock-keyboard.png" width="254" alt="Stock iOS keyboard limitations" />
</figure>

<p>For the most part I like the stock keyboard on iOS. It provides fast, accurate typing and I’m a big fan of <a href="http://www.imore.com/quicktype">QuickType</a>. One big problem with this keyboard is when you want to use emoji.</p>

<p>Often I find myself wanting to use a certain emoji, but not being exactly sure which section to find it under. Unless it is recently used, which automatically places it in the first tray of the emojis, you have to manually search through the various categories to find it. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There are plenty of examples where developers have recognised this issue and developed their own solutions to finding emoji, but I didn’t want another keyboard to have to switch between with the sole purpose of finding emoji.</p>

<h3 id="gboard---a-modern-keyboard">Gboard - A modern keyboard</h3>

<p>Gboard is just as functional as a normal keyboard, but adds some really cool features on top of it. It has its own version of QuickType, offering suggestions based on what you are writing as you go. Google is good at this sort of thing so it’s no surprise that it works flawlessly. Gboard also supports glide typing, similar to Swype and SwiftKey. Again, it works flawlessly.</p>

<p>My favourite thing about Gboard is how easy it makes finding emoji. Just tap on the emoji button and type what you are looking for in the search box. It’s ridiculously easy, and surely only a matter of time before Apple implement their own version.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/images/2016/9/gboard-emoji.png" width="254" alt="Gboard's emoji search" />
</figure>

<p>Gboard wouldn’t be a Google application without some form of Google search implemented. Clicking on the Google icon brings up a search, where you can quickly find links, images and gifs. This solves a problem I didn’t know I had. It’s now simple to send media without having to leave the application you are using.</p>

<p>I tried Gboard after hearing about it in passing on a <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected">podcast</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and it has surpassed any expectations I had of it. They have succeeded where Apple have failed in making the best keyboard for iOS. Maybe I should lose the skepticism around Google..</p>

  <p>Stephen Hackett on the possibility of a cellular Apple Watch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assuming it doesn’t cost me another $30/month for service, I’d be very interested in having my Watch be able to talk to a cellular network when I go out for a ride. Until then, my iPhone will be tucked in my back pocket.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.colm.io/2015/12/17/apple-watch-follow-up">talked</a> here before about how, in it’s current state, I wouldn’t find the Watch useful. If cellular data was to be added it it would make the Watch a lot more appealing to me. The idea of being able to go to go outside without having my phone would be a good enough reason in itself to buy one.</p>

  <p>If <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/11/27/iphone-7-headphone-jack-lightning/">rumors</a> are to be believed, the next iPhone will ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack. I have mixed feeling about that. While I understand (and agree with) the need to have less cables in our lives, this will be the single most disruptive change to the iPhone since it’s arrival. There’s no doubt that a lot more smartphones and devices will follow suit once Apple decide to remove it.</p>

<p>The 3.5mm jack has been around for a long time <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Almost every piece of technology that I own uses it, including my car! How Apple approaches this is important.</p>

<p>Presumably they will have some sort of adapter for the lightning port to allow 3.5mm jacks to be used. This should be included in the box with new phones, although that seems unlikely based on Apples track record in making a lot of money on overpriced
accessories.</p>

<p>Another question is what kind of headphones will be included with the new phones. <a href="http://www.apple.com/ie/shop/product/MD827ZM/B/apple-earpods-with-remote-and-mic">Earpods</a> are unlikely to be discontinued for some time, but they won’t work with the new iPhone if the jack is removed. Will Apple include bluetooth Earpods? Again, seems unlikely. But it would be bad for Apple to not include any earphones. That would be the first time they wouldn’t be included in the box since the original phone.</p>

<p>Bluetooth earphones/headphones have their own issues. They are generally more flimsy, more expensive and have to be charged or run on batteries. Who wants <em>another</em> battery to have to worry about? Is that not just creating a new problem that removing the jack was solving?</p>

<p>There doesn’t seem to be a way to make this transition pain free, but lets hope it is at least handled well. Best case scenario in my opinion? - include the adapter for free and let us make the transition at our own pace.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>The origins of the jack can be traced back as far as 1878! <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35253398">This article</a> explains its origins and how it became so prominent in technology over the following centuries. This isn’t like changing from the 30-pin dock connector to the lightning port - it’s a much bigger change, particularly for people who take their audio seriously. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>The Loop:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With all of the press it’s received in the past couple of weeks, it will come as no surprise that Pokemon Go has been a huge success. In fact, Apple told me today that the game has set a new App Store record with more downloads in its first week than any other app in history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although no actual numbers were mentioned by Apple, that is seriously impressive, even if it’s not entirely surprising. The real question from Nintendo’s perspective is how many people who downloaded Pokémon Go will still be playing it in six months time. I’ve been trying it out for the past week or so and while it’s definitely addictive and brings back a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue">memories</a>, it doesn’t take long to grow tired of having to have your phone in your hand while walking, or having to take detours that you wouldn’t usually take.</p>

<p>Pokémon Go could end up similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a>, where the novelty of movement while gaming soon grew old and people went back to the comfort couch gaming. I hope I’m wrong.</p>
