  <p>If <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/11/27/iphone-7-headphone-jack-lightning/">rumors</a> are to be believed, the next iPhone will ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack. I have mixed feeling about that. While I understand (and agree with) the need to have less cables in our lives, this will be the single most disruptive change to the iPhone since it’s arrival. There’s no doubt that a lot more smartphones and devices will follow suit once Apple decide to remove it.</p>

<p>The 3.5mm jack has been around for a long time <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Almost every piece of technology that I own uses it, including my car! How Apple approaches this is important.</p>

<p>Presumably they will have some sort of adapter for the lightning port to allow 3.5mm jacks to be used. This should be included in the box with new phones, although that seems unlikely based on Apples track record in making a lot of money on overpriced
accessories.</p>

<p>Another question is what kind of headphones will be included with the new phones. <a href="http://www.apple.com/ie/shop/product/MD827ZM/B/apple-earpods-with-remote-and-mic">Earpods</a> are unlikely to be discontinued for some time, but they won’t work with the new iPhone if the jack is removed. Will Apple include bluetooth Earpods? Again, seems unlikely. But it would be bad for Apple to not include any earphones. That would be the first time they wouldn’t be included in the box since the original phone.</p>

<p>Bluetooth earphones/headphones have their own issues. They are generally more flimsy, more expensive and have to be charged or run on batteries. Who wants <em>another</em> battery to have to worry about? Is that not just creating a new problem that removing the jack was solving?</p>

<p>There doesn’t seem to be a way to make this transition pain free, but lets hope it is at least handled well. Best case scenario in my opinion? - include the adapter for free and let us make the transition at our own pace.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>The origins of the jack can be traced back as far as 1878! <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35253398">This article</a> explains its origins and how it became so prominent in technology over the following centuries. This isn’t like changing from the 30-pin dock connector to the lightning port - it’s a much bigger change, particularly for people who take their audio seriously. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>The Loop:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With all of the press it’s received in the past couple of weeks, it will come as no surprise that Pokemon Go has been a huge success. In fact, Apple told me today that the game has set a new App Store record with more downloads in its first week than any other app in history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although no actual numbers were mentioned by Apple, that is seriously impressive, even if it’s not entirely surprising. The real question from Nintendo’s perspective is how many people who downloaded Pokémon Go will still be playing it in six months time. I’ve been trying it out for the past week or so and while it’s definitely addictive and brings back a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue">memories</a>, it doesn’t take long to grow tired of having to have your phone in your hand while walking, or having to take detours that you wouldn’t usually take.</p>

<p>Pokémon Go could end up similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a>, where the novelty of movement while gaming soon grew old and people went back to the comfort couch gaming. I hope I’m wrong.</p>

  <p>Interesting article from <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah">Chris Hannah</a> on how he manages notifications on iOS. It can be hard to decide which notifications should be enabled and which should be disabled on your phone. I have a lot of apps, most of which produce notifications on a daily basis. I spend <em>far</em> too much time checking my phone. To help combat this, I always leave my phone in <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3034720/ios/how-to-master-do-not-disturb-on-ios.html">Do Not Disturb</a> mode while at work, which ensures that my phone won’t wake each time I get a notification. This is a help, but doesn’t solve the problem.</p>

<p>In general, this is how I prioritise notifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Important: Calls, SMS/iMessage, Whatsapp</li>
  <li>Not Important: All social media, games, RSS, personal Email</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the above, I have adjusted how I get notifications on my phone. Anything in the important category gets pushed to my phone immediately, and anything in the not important must be looked up manually which prevents my phone from lighting up throughout the day. This is a small change but it’s definitely noticeable. It’s not going to cure my smartphone addiction, but it can surely help me get back some of those wasted minutes.</p>
