  <p>I understand Apple wanting to make sure that Siri’s core functionality of controlling your iOS device keeps getting better. That stuff should be bulletproof, but we’re five years into Siri’s life. The company should be moving past these features and making Siri smarter about the world around us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve long since given up on using Siri for anything more than questions like “When are Manchester United playing next?” or “What will the weather be like today?”. I don’t find it very useful for anything more than that. Siri has a long way to go to get close to the Amazon Echo or Google Assistant. Five years into its life, it still lacks the ability to understand some reasonably simple tasks:</p>

  <p>I enjoyed this review of the iPhone 7 on MacStories, particluarly the section on the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/09/12/apple-w1-chip-how-it-works/">W1 chip</a>. The iPhone 7 has brought about <a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/08/26/adios-headphone-jack">changes</a> that we may not be in a perfect position to take advantage of just yet, but in the near future will become the norm. Federico Viticci hit the nail on the head with his closing paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But using the iPhone 7 also made me appreciate the meaning of changes that will reshape the iPhone platform going forward – something that’s more significant than endlessly debating what we left behind.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iPhone 7 is a bold step towards a future we can start understanding today.</p>

  <p>Stephen Hackett:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now that the iPhone 7 starts at 32 GB of storage, the constant juggling needed to avoid a full device has been left behind by more users than ever before.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So let’s talk about iCloud storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>5 GB often isn’t enough to back up an iPhone and an iPad, let alone store years worth of family photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the latest <a href="http://www.androidguys.com/2016/10/07/google-photos-allows-for-free-unlimited-photo-and-video-storage-even-for-iphones-and-ipads/">announcement</a> from Google about unlimited storage for photos, the spotlight has shifted towards Apple, and it’s <em>very</em> stingy 5 GB free iCloud storage. Much like the 16 GB issue that has only recently been resolved <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, this needs to be looked at sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>An average user can hit the 5 GB limit very quickly if they actively take photos. This becomes a bigger problem if they have multiple devices. For photos alone even 10 GB may not be enough for a lot of users. Photos are irreplaceable. So many people must have lost memories because of this storage issue.</p>

<p>I like what Google have done here. They recognise the importance of photos, and historically have been generous with cloud storage sizes. If Apple is serious about catching up with Google on cloud services, storage size is an obvious candidate for change. Let’s hope so.</p>

      <p>Well, kind of. 32 GB is hardly a crazy increase, but it has bought Apple a year or two of having an acceptable base storage size. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>I listen to podcasts a lot, particularly while driving or walking to/from work. I don’t have a wide enough taste in music to always have something new to to listen to during these times, and I can’t rely on radio to have the shows I want when I want. Podcasts work best for me.</p>

<p>Here are some podcasts I listen to regulary. Most are weekly, others are more sporadic.</p>

<h4 id="accidental-tech-podcast">Accidental Tech Podcast</h4>
<p>The <a href="http:///atp.fm">show</a> is described as “Three nerds discussing tech, Apple, programming, and loosely related matters.” - and I think that tells you all you need to know about it. Add to that <a href="http://www.hypercritical.co">John Siracusa</a>’s typically razer sharp critique style and you got a good mix of entertainment and information.</p>

<h4 id="connected">Connected</h4>
<p>This is fairly similar to ATP, except the views are light on the technical and more on the user side of things. Worth the listen alone for Federico Viticcis (of <a href="http://www.macstories.net">MacStories</a>) insights into iOS. Find it on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected">Relay</a>.</p>

<h4 id="causality">Causality</h4>
<p>John Chidgey analyzes what went right and what went wrong during disasters. He breaks them down in an easy to follow format and comes up with his report card based on his own experience as an engineer. Causality is part of the <a href="http://engineered.network/causality">Engineered</a> network.</p>

<h4 id="monkey-tennis">Monkey Tennis</h4>
<p>One for the Partridge fans. Four fans of Alan Partridge go through each episode of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129690/">I’m Alan Partridge</a>, providing interesting facts and a <em>lot</em> of quotes. Find it <a href="http://www.postpoppodcasts.com/monkey-tennis/">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="dubland">Dubland</h4>
<p>Suzanne Kane and PJ Gallagher provide nearly an hour of entertainment regarding the goings on in Ireland for the previous week. They pick their heros of the week and tell us some strange animal facts. Hosted on <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/user-530592989">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

<h4 id="pod-a-rooney">Pod-a-rooney</h4>
<p>Comedian Joe Rooney <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> interviews people in the entertainment industry about how they got to where they are. Always an interesting listen with plenty of laughs along the way. It’s on <a href="http://castaway.media/podarooney/">Castaway Media</a>.</p>
