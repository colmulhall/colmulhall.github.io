  <p>Stephen Hackett on Control Center:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With iOS 7, Apple added Today, a section of Notification Center that users can fill with first- and third-party widgets, as well as Control Center, a quick way to get at commonly-used utilities with a flick up from the bottom of the display.
I don’t think this has aged very well, unfortunately, and it’s mostly Control Center’s fault. In addition to it being confusing to have a hidden panel at the top of the screen, having one at the bottom too is a lot to handle for some users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Center_(iOS)">Control Center</a>. I have used it daily since it’s introduction, and if it were to be removed it would make any iOS device frustrating to use. I don’t agree with Stephen that there needs to be a shift in how it is accessed on the device. I like the fact that there is a clear split between Notifications (pull down), and Utilities (pull up).</p>

<p>The only thing I would change is I would allow some more customisation in what utilities can be accessed through Control Center. I never use the calculator widget. I would prefer to be able to turn on a personal hotspot. Better yet, open it up to developers and allow them to build there own widgets. Maybe even some menus could be added that are specific to Control Center, allowing small interactions without opening apps themselves.</p>

<p>There are so many possibilities even in this one little corner of iOS.</p>

  <p>I am very happy with <a href="https://github.com/cliss/camel">Camel</a> having used it for the past two months, but the one thing I was missing was the ability to publish new posts or make edits on the go via mobile devices. I remembered <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2014/10/6/uncomfortable-riding-this-camel">reading</a> about this issue on Casey Liss’s site a while back so I said I would venture back through the archives to see was there any follow up to the problem.</p>

<p>Turns out <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2014/11/19/heroku-adds-dropbox-support">there is</a>!</p>

<p>Heroku can be connected to Dropbox which enables publishing on the go. The steps are easy, as Casey explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My mobile workflow is as follows:
	1.	Open up a text editor that speaks Dropbox and Markdown. For me, that’s Byword
	2.	Add/edit the files that need updating
	3.	Make sure those changes are saved to Dropbox
	4.	Go to the Heroku Dashboard, find the app in question, and open the Code tab
	5.	Add a commit message, and then click/tap Deploy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This also means there is no longer a need to use Git when deploying any changes which is another win. I now have most of the benefits of a more traditional CMS without any of the downsides.</p>

  <p>Interesting round up of the different generations of the iPod nano through the years. The first generation iPod nano was the first Apple device I owned. I got it back in 2006 in a 1Gb form. I remember at the time I couldn’t believe how thin it was and how easy it was to use. It has aged very well. I still use it from time to time, despite the pain of loading songs from iTunes.</p>

  <p>It’s unusual to see an update of this size coming to iOS at this time of the year, but it’s a welcome one. There’s been a lot of talk about Apple moving towards a different release schedule once iOS 10 gets shipped so it’s realistic that we’ll be seeing more of this kind of thing in the future.</p>

<p>The highlights of 9.3:</p>

<h4 id="night-shift">Night Shift</h4>
<center>
	<img src="/images/2016/1/night-shift.png" alt="Night Shift" />
</center>

<p>This is Apple’s attempt at creating (or copying) a screen brightness ..adjuster. Night Shift automatically changes the shade of your screen late in the evening to a warmer shade which is easier on the eyes and apparently improves sleep. The interesting thing is Apple <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/11/12/flux-iphone-sideloading-shut-down/">wouldn’t allow</a> Flux onto the App Store back late last year. Flux has been around for a long time and offers pretty much the exact same service that Night Shift does. This could be coincidental, or Apple could have had a panic moment and decided to implement their own version. My guess is that it was long in the pipeline. Either way it’s a welcome addition.</p>

<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>Notes has got a nice little update. You can now lock specific notes with a passcode or with Touch ID. I can think of a few scenarios where I would like to use this. I would like to see more of this though. Maybe the ability to lock message conversations or photo albums?</p>

<h4 id="all-the-rest">All The Rest</h4>
<ul>
  <li>News got an update, but we still don’t have it in Ireland.</li>
  <li>The Heath dashboard got an update. Looks nice, but I still haven’t found much use for the app itself.</li>
  <li>Maps in CarPlay got a nice update.</li>
  <li>Some education features were added.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Marco Arment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite the low-resolution screen, slow hard drives, very little RAM, and CPUs that were middling even  in 2012, it’s an open secret among Apple employees that the “101” still sells surprisingly well — to a nearly tragic degree, given its age and mediocrity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m right there with everyone else who’d strongly advise against buying this machine for most people  who’d ask me. But if someone has a tight budget, needs a lot of disk space, and doesn’t care about the  screen, it’s hard to argue against the 101.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back in 2013 when I was buying my first Mac I was torn between the ‘101’ mentioned here and the latest Retina MacBook Pro. For the same price I could either have a fully maxed out - but non-retina/SSD - MacBook Pro, or the newer Retina model which was thinner and lighter, but at my budget price point was at its lowest spec.</p>

<p>In the end I decided to get the older ‘101’ model. At the beginning I thought this was a wise choice as I was a Computer Science student at the time and assumed that I would have the need for an almost 3 GHz processor and 8 Gb of RAM. In reality, I had little need for the extra processing power, even though the RAM came in handy. I also wanted the 750 Gb hard drive the older model offered, which was the same price as a 128 Gb SSD on the Retina. (I could have just got an external hard drive for all those movies and TV shows.)</p>

<p>So while I agree with Marco that there is still a place in Apple’s lineup for this now outdated machine, I can’t say for sure that I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to buy a Mac today. The 101 has served me well for the last two odd years, but recently it has started to show its age. I never use the optical drive or the ethernet port, the disk seems to the be getting slower by the month, and I can’t bear to see a Retina screen on any other MacBook as it only highlights how bad the screen is on this laptop. This is not a 2016 MacBook.</p>

  <p>I mentioned in my <a href="http://www.colm.io/2015/12/22/must-have-ios-apps-2015-edition#instapaper">mini instapaper review</a> that I follow a lot of different websites. The number of these sites has grown over the last few months, making it a fairly time consuming task to keep up to date with them. Recently I have started to use RSS as a means of checking for new articles on each of these sites.</p>

<p>Now I am aware that RSS is fairly ancient in terms of technologies, but it was never something that I had much use for up until now. Back in 2013, Google decided to <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.ie/2013/07/a-final-farewell.html">shut down</a> Google Reader which was one of the most prominent RSS services on the web. At the time I remember reading about this and thinking what was the big deal. Why don’t people just browse the websites individually instead? But I was missing the point entirely. The main purpose of RSS is to offer convenience and time saving.</p>

<p>I discovered RSS after stumbled across a service called “<a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>”. This is a simple RSS reader which allows the user to store and organise any number of RSS feeds to their account. The excellent app crawls each of the feeds and displays any new articles that have yet to be seen.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="/images/2015/12/feedly1.PNG" width="254" />
</figure>
<p>What this means is I can flick through new articles for websites in a fraction of the time that it would take me to browse through each of those websites individually. I don’t find myself missing anything new from these sites now, and if there are too many articles to read they can go straight into Instapaper (Instapaper integration is built right in).</p>

<p>Feedly also offer their service through apps for Windows, OS X and, Android and through any browser. That kind of cross platform availability is rare these days. Just reading through their <a href="http://feedly.com/apps.html">apps page</a> shows just how many devices and users they can reach. There are countless other RSS services available to suit anyones tastes. Lets hope RSS is here to stay for a while to come.</p>

  <p>Federico Viticci’s mega reviews on MacStories are fast becoming some of my favourite things to read online. In his latest effort, he details must-have apps currently on iOS. His full time use of iOS has been <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/">well</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/">documented</a> so it’s only natural that he would have some good insights into how to get the best out of these devices.</p>

<p>Some of the apps mentioned which also fall on my list:</p>

<p><a id="1password"></a></p>

<h4 id="password">1Password</h4>
<p>I would be lost without this app. I have tried several password managers but nothing comes close to 1Password. All my logins, my driving license and passport details are safe behind the master password (or Touch ID). Extensions also make it easy to use these when browsing in Safari. iCloud Keychain has proven unreliable for me when I am working with several different devices, making 1Password my go-to password manager.</p>

<p><a id="twitter"></a></p>

<h4 id="twitter">Twitter</h4>
<p>I wouldn’t call myself a major Twitter user, but I do find myself checking it throughout the day. Twitters stock app works fine for me although if I were to use it for more than just consumption of tweets I can imagine there are better options.</p>

<p><a id="whatsapp"></a></p>

<h4 id="whatsapp">Whatsapp</h4>
<p>Whatsapp needs no introduction. I use this app every day for both private and group chats, and its reliable even with a poor connection. Recently they also added support for Whatsapp on the browser. Now if only they could support iPad..</p>

<p><a id="instapaper"></a></p>

<h4 id="instapaper">Instapaper</h4>
<p>I read a lot of different websites each day. Many of these have long articles which I don’t have time during my workday to read. Instapaper allows me to save these to read later on any device. The reading experience is usually better than the websites themselves as there are no adverts or strange popups to deal with. There have been a number of these read-it-later services since Instapaper first appeared, but none have managed to offer the same experience.</p>

<p><a id="pedometer"></a></p>

<h4 id="pedometer">Pedometer++</h4>
<p>David Smiths Pedometer++ is probably the simplest pedometer app that I’ve used, and that’s what I like most about it. It offers a simple chart indicating if you’ve hit your step goal for the day. The Notification Center widget also allows me to check my steps in real time without unlocking my phone.</p>

<p><a id="overcast"></a></p>

<h4 id="overcast">Overcast</h4>
<p>Overcast beats Apples stock podcast app because of it’s two great main features - Smart Speed, (which dynamically removes silences from the podcast, saving time without distorting the voices) and Voice Boost (which I’m not exactly sure what it does, but it makes everything sound a lot richer). The user interface is easy to navigate and new podcasts are easily discoverable.</p>

<p><a id="googlemaps"></a></p>

<h4 id="google-maps">Google Maps</h4>
<p>Google Maps is still my go-to map application. Apple Maps has a long way to go to match the accuracy and features of this. In fact I’d doubt that it ever will fully match it as Google have been at this game a lot longer.</p>
