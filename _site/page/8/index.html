  <p>Earlier this month I <a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/04/04/what-needs-fixing">posted</a> about what issues I was having with the website, and what I wanted to fix. Here is an update on these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Previous’ and ‘Newer’ links are now where they are supposed to be, with the exception of the final page</li>
  <li>Favicon got updated ✔</li>
  <li>Bigfoot footnotes are <a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/04/15/bigfoot-footnotes">now supported</a> ✔</li>
  <li>Support for Safari Reader ✔</li>
  <li>RSS entries are still duplicating, but not when using the alternative feed. Still needs investigating..</li>
  <li>Decided to stick with the same font ✔</li>
  <li>Responsiveness still needs working on</li>

  <p>Really good concept of what could be coming in iOS 10. My personal favourites are the advanced Control Center features, something which I have <a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/01/28/the-case-against-control-center">wanted for a while</a>, and system wide dark mode. I use dark mode whenever available in apps, so to see this all over would be really great. On a related note, MacStories have <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/introducing-macstories-dark-theme-and-telegram-channel/">introduced a dark mode</a> on the site to mark their seven year anniversary. Some good work has gone into that site in the last few months.</p>

  <p>Shaun Musgrave on what the App Store was like in earlier days:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, I’m not going to lie, friends. Playing Ravensword: Shadowlands makes me a little sad. When this game hit, things looked really hopeful for premium, relatively high-end RPGs on iOS. The market enthusiastically supported games like these, and thus publishers were able to justify sinking greater and greater costs into them. But things were already changing as Ravensword: Shadowlands hit, and the market would soon swing in a major way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a real shame that games like this are no longer sustainable on the App Store. I’d love to see something like The Elder Scrolls making it to mobile devices, but the reality is there is no way any game developer is going to sink their money into a project like that. It seems that as iOS hardware gets better, games are getting less complex, and can only stay profitable through in-app purchases.</p>

    	<h3><a href="/2016/04/15/bigfoot-footnotes/">Better footnotes with bigfoot.js </a></h3>

  <p>Chris Sauvé on why footnotes on the web are a pain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Footnotes on the web are a pain in the ass. You click on a tiny number, get transported somewhere near the bottom of the page, find the footnote you were looking for, and click on a link to go back to where you were on the page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris created a solution to this problem in the form of a jQuery plugin called <a href="http://bigfootjs.com/">bigfoot</a>. Bigfoot allows you to click on a footnote and instead of getting pushed down to your footnote at the bottom of the page, you get a nice little pop up. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I decided to implement these as part of <a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/04/04/what-needs-fixing">a todo list</a> which I am still working my way through. I’m not a heavy footnote user, but I’ve seen bigfoot used on enough websites now to know that I don’t want to go back to traditional footnotes.</p>

<p>Camel, the engine which powers this blog, already supports footnotes thanks to <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2015/1/15/camel-changes">this</a> update last year. Luckily it’s fairly easy to implement bigfoot on top of this. The first step is to download the project from the <a href="http://bigfootjs.com/">website</a> into your Camel file system. Although they can be put together into one file I chose to separate the bigfoot CSS from my site CSS <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-html">
&lt;!-- Stylesheets --&gt; 
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/css/site.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/css/bigfoot.css&quot;&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>Next, I downloaded jQuery from the <a href="http://jquery.com/download/">official website</a>. Once it was downloaded I added it to my file system in a ‘js’ folder, along with the bigfoot resources. The last thing you need to do is add the following anywhere on the page to enable bigfoot:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-html">
&lt;!-- jQuery --&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/js/jquery/jquery-2.2.3.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- Bigfoot Footnotes --&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/js/bigfoot/dist/bigfoot.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    $.bigfoot();
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>In order for bigfoot to work, you need to make sure that footnotes resemble something like this in your code:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-html">
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>Luckily, Camel supports MultiMarkdown which displays footnotes like this. But if you are using a different engine/CMS this may be done differently.</p>

<p>I had to do a <em>lot</em> of tweaking of the CSS to make the footnotes look how I wanted. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Funnily enough that is what took me the longest to figure out, and it still isn’t perfect (CSS gradients are confusing). It’s also worth noting that there are several bigfoot <a href="http://bigfootjs.com/#options">options</a> available to you, each of which are detailed on the website. I wanted to retain the footnotes with anchor links as the bottom of my posts. To do this you can use the actionOriginalFN: “ignore” option. This does exactly what you would think in that it ignores any original footnote markup. This can be added to the bigfoot script tag:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-html">
 &lt;!-- Bigfoot Footnotes --&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/js/bigfoot/dist/bigfoot.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    $.bigfoot({
        actionOriginalFN: &quot;ignore&quot;
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>And that’s it! This was an interesting exercise to undertake and I think it makes a big difference to the browsing experience on the website. I may revisit the CSS of the footnotes at a later stage but for now I am happy.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Like this! <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>I changed the name of ‘bigfoot-default.css’ to ‘bigfoot.css’. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>Like a lot of things on this site, they are heavily influenced by <a href="https://marco.org/">Marco.org</a>. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Nice idea from Instapaper. Their web parser must be really impressive. I very rarely come across a website that it can’t parse for reading, and I save a <em>lot</em> of articles. Web design has moved on a lot in the last decade and the number of different languages and frameworks has grown to an almost comical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_frameworks">number</a>, making this task harder and harder. When I was writing my final year project I wrote a fairly basic parser (<a href="https://github.com/colmulhall/FYP-Web-Coding">link</a>) which targeted a small number of websites for news and information on the Phoenix Park in Dublin. The headaches I had trying to parse relevant information even from these relatively simple websites were..painful. It makes sense from Instapapers perspective and everyone elses if they don’t have to write their own.</p>

  <p>I’ll eventually get around to fixing these issues with the site, but that day is not today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <s>'Older' and 'Newer' links between pages should be either side of the page, not together</s>
  </li>
  <li>
    <s>Favicon needs updating to make it less crap</s>

    <s>Support for Bigfoot footnotes</s>

  <li>Support for Safari Reader</li>
  <li>Fix issue where RSS entries are duplicating</li>
  <li>Unified font between different OS’s</li>
  <li>Responsivness fix for small tablet sizes`</li>

<p>It’s times like this that I’m glad I didn’t write the engine myself!</p>

  <p>Fraser Speirs on choosing between the new iPad Pro 9.7-inch and the iPad Air 2 for the classroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have to be honest and say I don’t find this an easy call. My future-proofing paranoia says iPad Pro. My budgeting spreadsheet says that the iPad Air 2 is good enough for the next 3 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My problem is that, processor performance aside, many of the Pro features just aren’t that important to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While my needs are a lot different to Fraser’s, there is still a lot to take from his analysis here. As I <a href="http://colm.io/2016/02/26/ipad-pro-9-7/">mentioned</a> previously, I am on the market for a new 9.7-inch iPad. After Apples Monday event, I was left with two choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>128Gb iPad Pro 9.7-inch</li>
  <li>64Gb iPad Air 2</li>
</ul>

<p>The advantages of the Pro over the Air 2 are obvious: Pencil support, better speakers, True Tone display, upgraded processor and Smart Connector. Of those five features, only one of them is important to me - the upgraded processor.</p>

<p>The iPad Air 2 carries an A8X chip which delivers 1,800 Geekbench points in the single-core test and 4,500 in multi-core. The Pro carries a A9X chip which delivers 3,000 Geekbench points for single-core and 5,100 in multi-core. Both tablets have 2Gb RAM which surprised me. If the Pro had 4Gb like its <a href="http://www.apple.com/ie/ipad-pro/">bigger brother</a> it would make this choice a lot easier.</p>

<p>For me an iPad is mainly an entertainment device. Something I can use to browse the web, social media, play games and watch movies. I don’t particularly need or want to get any work done on it. That pushes me closer to the Air 2. The price difference is also significant. €879 for a 128Gb Pro and a 64Gb Air 2 for €549. That’s a huge difference. I don’t think it makes sense to spend that kind of money on a Pro unless you plan on using it to get work done.</p>

<p>The one thing putting me off the Air 2 is the fact that it is a 2014 device. It goes against everything I’ve learned about buying tech to get a device that is a year and a half old. By the time September comes, it’ll already be onto its second major iOS update, iOS 10. That’s not good news when I plan on keeping this tablet for at least three years. But I think the Air 2 is unique in the fact that when it was released it was notably <a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/10/21/the-ipad-air-2-is-much-faster-than-the-iphone-6-and-the-original-ipad-air/">overpowered</a>. Many reviewers at the time were scratching their heads over why Apple would create such strong hardware, but not make use of it with the software. iOS 9, which brought true multitasking, answered that question. That gives me some comfort that it should still have at least two years of good life in it. As Fraser concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After Writing all this, I’m still not that sure. What I do think, though, is that I’m a lot more comfortable now with the option of going to the iPad Air 2 instead of the 9.7” iPad Pro.
If we have the budget, we’ll go Pro. If not, I don’t think the Air 2 will be a bad choice at all. It’s still a great iPad.</p>
