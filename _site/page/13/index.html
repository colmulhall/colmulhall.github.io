  <p>Stephen Hackett reflects on the Apple Watch a few months on from his <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/8/review-three-months-of-apple-watch">initial review</a>. His summary of how he has started to lose interest in the watch confirms some of my initial worries about it. At no point in my day at work would I feel the need to access notifications on my wrist. If anything, the watch would just act as a distraction.</p>

<p>I would like to have notifications or the ability to play/pause media while on the move without having to take out my phone, but if this is my only use for the watch then I don’t think it’s worth looking into any time soon.</p>

  <p>For a while I have been thinking about creating my own website as a place to find me online away from social media. I have previously used Blogspot and more recently <a href="http://www.colmulhall.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> for this purpose, but neither stuck for very long. Part of this was because I had lost interest in maintaining them, but another reason was that I was unhappy with the different blogging platforms available. They make it easy to set up a new site for yourself that looks and functions much better than anything I could dream of creating, but it’s a little too easy. All that is involved is selecting a template and making a few little changes to the pages that come with the template and - done. It feels like another social media account.</p>

<p>I have almost no experience in web development, so rather than spending a lot of time learning the basics I decided to dive right in and make use of an <a href="https://github.com/cliss/camels">open source</a> blogging engine, which requires more than just selecting a template and title, but forces me to understand some of the fundamentals of web development. This approach allows me to take a step back from the low-level ins and outs of a developing a blogging engine and lets me make my own changes as I learn how it all fits together. Hopefully by putting more effort into this site I will encourage myself to learn and write more in the future.</p>
