  <p>As expected, Apple announced their latest updates to the Mac line in yesterdays “Hello Again” event. I didn’t watch the event myself, but I caught up with people’s opinions on the announcements this morning. Some of the highlights:</p>

<p><a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/10/27/new-macbook-pros-and-the-state-of-the-mac/">Michael Tsai</a> was dissapointed with the announcments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new MacBook Pro has a premium price for a Mac that’s still limited to 16 GB of RAM, has CPU performance that is likely lackluster because Apple didn’t talk about it in the keynote, and apparently doesn’t have such a great GPU, either. Apple prioritized thinness and lightness, which I care about hardly at all. I would rather have better performance, a good keyboard, more storage, a larger display, more ports so I don’t have to carry dongles, an SD card slot, etc. Double the weight and half the battery life would be fine with me. I’m not saying Apple shouldn’t make thin and light notebooks, but why do they all have to be that way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/10/the-mac-line-is-still-kinda-broken/">Stephen Hackett</a> liked the new Touch Bar, but pointed out that Apple still haven’t addressed their full lineup - most notably their desktops:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The notebook line is pretty confusing right now. There are several machines — ahem, MacBook Air — that seem to exist to hit a price point. I understand and respect that, but I am already dreading offering buying advice over the next year.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But there’s a bigger problem. Apple may have fixed what was wrong with its notebook line, but the Mac is still broken. Just look at the MacRumors Buyer’s Guide:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marco Arment mentioned the elephant in the room - price:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The substantial price increases are putting a big damper on these announcements for a lot of people.</p>&mdash; Marco Arment (@marcoarment) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/791720032753557506">October 27, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Genarally speaking, these are some good updates to the MacBook line. The new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/macos/touch-bar/">Touch Bar</a> looks like a great way to add an extra user input option in a less clumsy way than a touch screen, and they are thinner, lighter and faster than ever before.</p>

<p>But all that aside, there’s no getting away from the price. The <em>cheapest</em> MacBook Pro with the new Touch Bar is €2099. <strong>TWO THOUSAND AND NINETY NINE EURO</strong> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Macs were never cheap, but I think at this price point, Apple has raised the bar to a price point that just can’t be justified by many people, myself included. This is the exact opposite of what the Mac needs right now, and obviously won’t help their <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/10/apples-fiscal-4th-quarter-in-5-charts/">struggling</a> mac sales.</p>

<p>The Mac already seems like it’s a bit of an afterthought at Apple. Spending that sort of money on a product that most likely won’t see a meaningful update for a long time seems like a bad move. I won’t be abandoning my ‘<a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/01/04/non-retina-macbook-pro-still-sells">101</a>’ any time soon.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>And that’s just a 13 inch base model. If you want a 15 inch Pro you’re paying dangerously close to the €3000 mark for the <em>base</em> model. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>I’m terrible when it comes to design and fashion, or anything even remotely related to them. So when it comes to making changes around those areas, I am a little…uneasy.</p>

<p>I recently made slight changes to the appearance of the blog. This is something I imagine I will do fairly regularly as it evolves, until I’m happy with a particular design <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. The main change I wanted to try out was a darker background. I’m a big fan of dark themes in software applications. They are easier on the eye, and in my opinion they just <em>look</em> better. For that reason, I wanted to try out a dark background. It may not be to everyones taste but I wanted to see if it holds up after a couple of weeks of use.</p>

<p>I recently came across an article by Matt Gemmell from a few years back entitled “<a href="http://mattgemmell.com/designing-blogs-for-readers/">Designing blogs for readers</a>”. In it, he details how the design of his own blog has evolved through the previous decade(!), starting out with a cluttered design full of every possible widget known to man, and eventually working it’s way to a simple design with the reader in mind. He then goes on to document his own set of guidlelines for blog readibility. Of those, I violate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Date-based index pages</li>
  <li>A feed button</li>
  <li>Background textures or colours</li>
</ul>

<p>These are relatively minor things, and I’m not too bothered about them. I like date indices. I’m in the (presumable) minority in the fact that I regularly use date indexes when visiting blogs that have them. The RSS button on my header is hardly neccesary, but again is pretty useful to have available on each page <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. As discussed above, I like darker themes, so having a background colour to me is often seen as a good thing.</p>

<p>Matt definitely has some great points in his post, but it’s ok to put your own stamp on what is essentially <em>your</em> website.</p>

<p>There is still plenty of things that I would like to try out on the site, such as footers, linked lists, recent posts, a logo, more experimentation with blogging engines and publishing with Apple News. That’s more than enough to keep me busy. I may end up linking this post sometime in the future to show how right or wrong I was, or how lazy I am for not following up.</p>

    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>In the future I may consider adding a footer to the site, which is where I would probably add the RSS link. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>David Smith:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Four years ago today I introduced a weather app called Check the Weather. I was really proud of how it turned out. It was my first app where I was able to do everything ‘right’ from the beginning. It was localized, had solid VoiceOver support and had an actual marketing plan to get it off the ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sadly, however, the time has come to discontinue support for the app. The cost of providing weather data to it has grown too large to sustain. It has been operating at a slight loss for the last 2 years, which I didn’t mind providing as I used the app myself. However, a recent change in the pricing for my radar data provider has made it infeasible to continue providing weather data for the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Check the Weather has been my go to weather app for the past few years. It’s a shame to see it go.</p>

  <p>I understand Apple wanting to make sure that Siri’s core functionality of controlling your iOS device keeps getting better. That stuff should be bulletproof, but we’re five years into Siri’s life. The company should be moving past these features and making Siri smarter about the world around us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve long since given up on using Siri for anything more than questions like “When are Manchester United playing next?” or “What will the weather be like today?”. I don’t find it very useful for anything more than that. Siri has a long way to go to get close to the Amazon Echo or Google Assistant. Five years into its life, it still lacks the ability to understand some reasonably simple tasks:</p>

  <p>I enjoyed this review of the iPhone 7 on MacStories, particluarly the section on the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/09/12/apple-w1-chip-how-it-works/">W1 chip</a>. The iPhone 7 has brought about <a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/08/26/adios-headphone-jack">changes</a> that we may not be in a perfect position to take advantage of just yet, but in the near future will become the norm. Federico Viticci hit the nail on the head with his closing paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But using the iPhone 7 also made me appreciate the meaning of changes that will reshape the iPhone platform going forward – something that’s more significant than endlessly debating what we left behind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iPhone 7 is a bold step towards a future we can start understanding today.</p>

  <p>Stephen Hackett:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now that the iPhone 7 starts at 32 GB of storage, the constant juggling needed to avoid a full device has been left behind by more users than ever before.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So let’s talk about iCloud storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>5 GB often isn’t enough to back up an iPhone and an iPad, let alone store years worth of family photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the latest <a href="http://www.androidguys.com/2016/10/07/google-photos-allows-for-free-unlimited-photo-and-video-storage-even-for-iphones-and-ipads/">announcement</a> from Google about unlimited storage for photos, the spotlight has shifted towards Apple, and it’s <em>very</em> stingy 5 GB free iCloud storage. Much like the 16 GB issue that has only recently been resolved <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, this needs to be looked at sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>An average user can hit the 5 GB limit very quickly if they actively take photos. This becomes a bigger problem if they have multiple devices. For photos alone even 10 GB may not be enough for a lot of users. Photos are irreplaceable. So many people must have lost memories because of this storage issue.</p>

<p>I like what Google have done here. They recognise the importance of photos, and historically have been generous with cloud storage sizes. If Apple is serious about catching up with Google on cloud services, storage size is an obvious candidate for change. Let’s hope so.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Well, kind of. 32 GB is hardly a crazy increase, but it has bought Apple a year or two of having an acceptable base storage size. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>I listen to podcasts a lot, particularly while driving or walking to/from work. I don’t have a wide enough taste in music to always have something new to to listen to during these times, and I can’t rely on radio to have the shows I want when I want. Podcasts work best for me.</p>

<p>Here are some podcasts I listen to regulary. Most are weekly, others are more sporadic.</p>

<h4 id="accidental-tech-podcast">Accidental Tech Podcast</h4>
<p>The <a href="http:///atp.fm">show</a> is described as “Three nerds discussing tech, Apple, programming, and loosely related matters.” - and I think that tells you all you need to know about it. Add to that <a href="http://www.hypercritical.co">John Siracusa</a>’s typically razer sharp critique style and you got a good mix of entertainment and information.</p>

<h4 id="connected">Connected</h4>
<p>This is fairly similar to ATP, except the views are light on the technical and more on the user side of things. Worth the listen alone for Federico Viticcis (of <a href="http://www.macstories.net">MacStories</a>) insights into iOS. Find it on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected">Relay</a>.</p>

<h4 id="causality">Causality</h4>
<p>John Chidgey analyzes what went right and what went wrong during disasters. He breaks them down in an easy to follow format and comes up with his report card based on his own experience as an engineer. Causality is part of the <a href="http://engineered.network/causality">Engineered</a> network.</p>

<h4 id="monkey-tennis">Monkey Tennis</h4>
<p>One for the Partridge fans. Four fans of Alan Partridge go through each episode of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129690/">I’m Alan Partridge</a>, providing interesting facts and a <em>lot</em> of quotes. Find it <a href="http://www.postpoppodcasts.com/monkey-tennis/">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="dubland">Dubland</h4>
<p>Suzanne Kane and PJ Gallagher provide nearly an hour of entertainment regarding the goings on in Ireland for the previous week. They pick their heros of the week and tell us some strange animal facts. Hosted on <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/user-530592989">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

<h4 id="pod-a-rooney">Pod-a-rooney</h4>
<p>Comedian Joe Rooney <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> interviews people in the entertainment industry about how they got to where they are. Always an interesting listen with plenty of laughs along the way. It’s on <a href="http://castaway.media/podarooney/">Castaway Media</a>.</p>

  <p>When Apple brought out support for third party keyboards in iOS 8, I tried out several of them, such as <a href="http://www.swype.com/product-features/ios/features.html">Swype</a> and <a href="https://swiftkey.com/en/keyboard/ios">SwiftKey</a>. None of these came close to the ever-reliable stock iOS keyboard. So when Google <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.ie/2016/05/gboard-search-gifs-emojis-keyboard.html">announced</a> their new iOS keyboard ‘Gboard’, I didn’t have high hopes. Not for the first time however, Google have answered the call and surprised me with their take on how a keyboard should work.</p>

<h3 id="the-stock-ios-keyboard">The stock iOS keyboard</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="/images/2016/9/stock-keyboard.png" width="254" alt="Stock iOS keyboard limitations" />
</figure>

<p>For the most part I like the stock keyboard on iOS. It provides fast, accurate typing and I’m a big fan of <a href="http://www.imore.com/quicktype">QuickType</a>. One big problem with this keyboard is when you want to use emoji.</p>

<p>Often I find myself wanting to use a certain emoji, but not being exactly sure which section to find it under. Unless it is recently used, which automatically places it in the first tray of the emojis, you have to manually search through the various categories to find it. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There are plenty of examples where developers have recognised this issue and developed their own solutions to finding emoji, but I didn’t want another keyboard to have to switch between with the sole purpose of finding emoji.</p>

<p>Gboard is just as functional as a normal keyboard, but adds some really cool features on top of it. It has its own version of QuickType, offering suggestions based on what you are writing as you go. Google is good at this sort of thing so it’s no surprise that it works flawlessly. Gboard also supports glide typing, similar to Swype and SwiftKey. Again, it works flawlessly.</p>

<p>My favourite thing about Gboard is how easy it makes finding emoji. Just tap on the emoji button and type what you are looking for in the search box. It’s ridiculously easy, and surely only a matter of time before Apple implement their own version.</p>

<p>Gboard wouldn’t be a Google application without some form of Google search implemented. Clicking on the Google icon brings up a search, where you can quickly find links, images and gifs. This solves a problem I didn’t know I had. It’s now simple to send media without having to leave the application you are using.</p>

<p>I tried Gboard after hearing about it in passing on a <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected">podcast</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and it has surpassed any expectations I had of it. They have succeeded where Apple have failed in making the best keyboard for iOS. Maybe I should lose the skepticism around Google..</p>
