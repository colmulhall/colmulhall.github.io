  <p>Stephen Hackett:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now that the iPhone 7 starts at 32 GB of storage, the constant juggling needed to avoid a full device has been left behind by more users than ever before.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So let’s talk about iCloud storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>5 GB often isn’t enough to back up an iPhone and an iPad, let alone store years worth of family photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the latest <a href="http://www.androidguys.com/2016/10/07/google-photos-allows-for-free-unlimited-photo-and-video-storage-even-for-iphones-and-ipads/">announcement</a> from Google about unlimited storage for photos, the spotlight has shifted towards Apple, and it’s <em>very</em> stingy 5 GB free iCloud storage. Much like the 16 GB issue that has only recently been resolved <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, this needs to be looked at sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>An average user can hit the 5 GB limit very quickly if they actively take photos. This becomes a bigger problem if they have multiple devices. For photos alone even 10 GB may not be enough for a lot of users. Photos are irreplaceable. So many people must have lost memories because of this storage issue.</p>

<p>I like what Google have done here. They recognise the importance of photos, and historically have been generous with cloud storage sizes. If Apple is serious about catching up with Google on cloud services, storage size is an obvious candidate for change. Let’s hope so.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Well, kind of. 32 GB is hardly a crazy increase, but it has bought Apple a year or two of having an acceptable base storage size. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>I listen to podcasts a lot, particularly while driving or walking to/from work. I don’t have a wide enough taste in music to always have something new to to listen to during these times, and I can’t rely on radio to have the shows I want when I want. Podcasts work best for me.</p>

<p>Here are some podcasts I listen to regulary. Most are weekly, others are more sporadic.</p>

<h4 id="accidental-tech-podcast">Accidental Tech Podcast</h4>
<p>The <a href="http:///atp.fm">show</a> is described as “Three nerds discussing tech, Apple, programming, and loosely related matters.” - and I think that tells you all you need to know about it. Add to that <a href="http://www.hypercritical.co">John Siracusa</a>’s typically razer sharp critique style and you got a good mix of entertainment and information.</p>

<h4 id="connected">Connected</h4>
<p>This is fairly similar to ATP, except the views are light on the technical and more on the user side of things. Worth the listen alone for Federico Viticcis (of <a href="http://www.macstories.net">MacStories</a>) insights into iOS. Find it on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected">Relay</a>.</p>

<h4 id="causality">Causality</h4>
<p>John Chidgey analyzes what went right and what went wrong during disasters. He breaks them down in an easy to follow format and comes up with his report card based on his own experience as an engineer. Causality is part of the <a href="http://engineered.network/causality">Engineered</a> network.</p>

<h4 id="monkey-tennis">Monkey Tennis</h4>
<p>One for the Partridge fans. Four fans of Alan Partridge go through each episode of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129690/">I’m Alan Partridge</a>, providing interesting facts and a <em>lot</em> of quotes. Find it <a href="http://www.postpoppodcasts.com/monkey-tennis/">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="dubland">Dubland</h4>
<p>Suzanne Kane and PJ Gallagher provide nearly an hour of entertainment regarding the goings on in Ireland for the previous week. They pick their heros of the week and tell us some strange animal facts. Hosted on <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/user-530592989">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

<h4 id="pod-a-rooney">Pod-a-rooney</h4>
<p>Comedian Joe Rooney <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> interviews people in the entertainment industry about how they got to where they are. Always an interesting listen with plenty of laughs along the way. It’s on <a href="http://castaway.media/podarooney/">Castaway Media</a>.</p>

  <p>When Apple brought out support for third party keyboards in iOS 8, I tried out several of them, such as <a href="http://www.swype.com/product-features/ios/features.html">Swype</a> and <a href="https://swiftkey.com/en/keyboard/ios">SwiftKey</a>. None of these came close to the ever-reliable stock iOS keyboard. So when Google <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.ie/2016/05/gboard-search-gifs-emojis-keyboard.html">announced</a> their new iOS keyboard ‘Gboard’, I didn’t have high hopes. Not for the first time however, Google have answered the call and surprised me with their take on how a keyboard should work.</p>

<h3 id="the-stock-ios-keyboard">The stock iOS keyboard</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="/images/2016/9/stock-keyboard.png" width="254" alt="Stock iOS keyboard limitations" />
</figure>

<p>For the most part I like the stock keyboard on iOS. It provides fast, accurate typing and I’m a big fan of <a href="http://www.imore.com/quicktype">QuickType</a>. One big problem with this keyboard is when you want to use emoji.</p>

<p>Often I find myself wanting to use a certain emoji, but not being exactly sure which section to find it under. Unless it is recently used, which automatically places it in the first tray of the emojis, you have to manually search through the various categories to find it. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There are plenty of examples where developers have recognised this issue and developed their own solutions to finding emoji, but I didn’t want another keyboard to have to switch between with the sole purpose of finding emoji.</p>

<h3 id="gboard---a-modern-keyboard">Gboard - A modern keyboard</h3>

<p>Gboard is just as functional as a normal keyboard, but adds some really cool features on top of it. It has its own version of QuickType, offering suggestions based on what you are writing as you go. Google is good at this sort of thing so it’s no surprise that it works flawlessly. Gboard also supports glide typing, similar to Swype and SwiftKey. Again, it works flawlessly.</p>

<p>My favourite thing about Gboard is how easy it makes finding emoji. Just tap on the emoji button and type what you are looking for in the search box. It’s ridiculously easy, and surely only a matter of time before Apple implement their own version.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/images/2016/9/gboard-emoji.png" width="254" alt="Gboard's emoji search" />
</figure>

<p>Gboard wouldn’t be a Google application without some form of Google search implemented. Clicking on the Google icon brings up a search, where you can quickly find links, images and gifs. This solves a problem I didn’t know I had. It’s now simple to send media without having to leave the application you are using.</p>

<p>I tried Gboard after hearing about it in passing on a <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected">podcast</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and it has surpassed any expectations I had of it. They have succeeded where Apple have failed in making the best keyboard for iOS. Maybe I should lose the skepticism around Google..</p>

  <p>Stephen Hackett on the possibility of a cellular Apple Watch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assuming it doesn’t cost me another $30/month for service, I’d be very interested in having my Watch be able to talk to a cellular network when I go out for a ride. Until then, my iPhone will be tucked in my back pocket.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.colm.io/2015/12/17/apple-watch-follow-up">talked</a> here before about how, in it’s current state, I wouldn’t find the Watch useful. If cellular data was to be added it it would make the Watch a lot more appealing to me. The idea of being able to go to go outside without having my phone would be a good enough reason in itself to buy one.</p>

  <p>If <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/11/27/iphone-7-headphone-jack-lightning/">rumors</a> are to be believed, the next iPhone will ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack. I have mixed feeling about that. While I understand (and agree with) the need to have less cables in our lives, this will be the single most disruptive change to the iPhone since it’s arrival. There’s no doubt that a lot more smartphones and devices will follow suit once Apple decide to remove it.</p>

<p>The 3.5mm jack has been around for a long time <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Almost every piece of technology that I own uses it, including my car! How Apple approaches this is important.</p>

<p>Presumably they will have some sort of adapter for the lightning port to allow 3.5mm jacks to be used. This should be included in the box with new phones, although that seems unlikely based on Apples track record in making a lot of money on overpriced
accessories.</p>

<p>Another question is what kind of headphones will be included with the new phones. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_earbuds#Apple_EarPods">Earpods</a> are unlikely to be discontinued for some time, but they won’t work with the new iPhone if the jack is removed. Will Apple include bluetooth Earpods? Again, seems unlikely. But it would be bad for Apple to not include any earphones. That would be the first time they wouldn’t be included in the box since the original phone.</p>

<p>Bluetooth earphones/headphones have their own issues. They are generally more flimsy, more expensive and have to be charged or run on batteries. Who wants <em>another</em> battery to have to worry about? Is that not just creating a new problem that removing the jack was solving?</p>

<p>There doesn’t seem to be a way to make this transition pain free, but lets hope it is at least handled well. Best case scenario in my opinion? - include the adapter for free and let us make the transition at our own pace.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>The origins of the jack can be traced back as far as 1878! <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35253398">This article</a> explains its origins and how it became so prominent in technology over the following centuries. This isn’t like changing from the 30-pin dock connector to the lightning port - it’s a much bigger change, particularly for people who take their audio seriously. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>The Loop:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With all of the press it’s received in the past couple of weeks, it will come as no surprise that Pokemon Go has been a huge success. In fact, Apple told me today that the game has set a new App Store record with more downloads in its first week than any other app in history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although no actual numbers were mentioned by Apple, that is seriously impressive, even if it’s not entirely surprising. The real question from Nintendo’s perspective is how many people who downloaded Pokémon Go will still be playing it in six months time. I’ve been trying it out for the past week or so and while it’s definitely addictive and brings back a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue">memories</a>, it doesn’t take long to grow tired of having to have your phone in your hand while walking, or having to take detours that you wouldn’t usually take.</p>

<p>Pokémon Go could end up similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a>, where the novelty of movement while gaming soon grew old and people went back to the comfort couch gaming. I hope I’m wrong.</p>

  <p>Interesting article from <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah">Chris Hannah</a> on how he manages notifications on iOS. It can be hard to decide which notifications should be enabled and which should be disabled on your phone. I have a lot of apps, most of which produce notifications on a daily basis. I spend <em>far</em> too much time checking my phone. To help combat this, I always leave my phone in <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3034720/ios/how-to-master-do-not-disturb-on-ios.html">Do Not Disturb</a> mode while at work, which ensures that my phone won’t wake each time I get a notification. This is a help, but doesn’t solve the problem.</p>

<p>In general, this is how I prioritise notifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Important: Calls, SMS/iMessage, Whatsapp</li>
  <li>Not Important: All social media, games, RSS, personal Email</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the above, I have adjusted how I get notifications on my phone. Anything in the important category gets pushed to my phone immediately, and anything in the not important must be looked up manually which prevents my phone from lighting up throughout the day. This is a small change but it’s definitely noticeable. It’s not going to cure my smartphone addiction, but it can surely help me get back some of those wasted minutes.</p>
