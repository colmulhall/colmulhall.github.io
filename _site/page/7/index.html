  <p>And yet there <em>still</em> isn’t any sign of an iPad version of their app. Apps like <a href="http://www.theflowapp.com/">Flow</a> have done a great job in bringing Instagram to iPad, but now with the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/17/just-instagram/">changes to the Instagram API</a> we’re back to square one. It’s sad to see them lose out because of this.</p>

  <p>Really good concept of what could be coming in iOS 10. My personal favourites are the advanced Control Center features, something which I have <a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/1/28/the-case-against-control-center">wanted for a while</a>, and system wide dark mode. I use dark mode whenever available in apps, so to see this all over would be really great. On a related note, MacStories have <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/introducing-macstories-dark-theme-and-telegram-channel/">introduced a dark mode</a> on the site to mark their seven year anniversary. Some good work has gone into that site in the last few months.</p>

  <p>Shaun Musgrave on what the App Store was like in earlier days:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, I’m not going to lie, friends. Playing Ravensword: Shadowlands makes me a little sad. When this game hit, things looked really hopeful for premium, relatively high-end RPGs on iOS. The market enthusiastically supported games like these, and thus publishers were able to justify sinking greater and greater costs into them. But things were already changing as Ravensword: Shadowlands hit, and the market would soon swing in a major way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a real shame that games like this are no longer sustainable on the App Store. I’d love to see something like The Elder Scrolls making it to mobile devices, but the reality is there is no way any game developer is going to sink their money into a project like that. It seems that as iOS hardware gets better, games are getting less complex, and can only stay profitable through in-app purchases.</p>

  <p>Chris Sauvé on why footnotes on the web are a pain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Footnotes on the web are a pain in the ass. You click on a tiny number, get transported somewhere near the bottom of the page, find the footnote you were looking for, and click on a link to go back to where you were on the page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris created a solution to this problem in the form of a jQuery plugin called <a href="http://bigfootjs.com/">bigfoot</a>. Bigfoot allows you to click on a footnote and instead of getting pushed down to your footnote at the bottom of the page, you get a nice little pop up. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I decided to implement these as part of <a href="http://www.colm.io/2016/4/4/what-needs-fixing">a todo list</a> which I am still working my way through. I’m not a heavy footnote user, but I’ve seen bigfoot used on enough websites now to know that I don’t want to go back to traditional footnotes.</p>

<p>Camel, the engine which powers this blog, already supports footnotes thanks to <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2015/1/15/camel-changes">this</a> update last year. Luckily it’s fairly easy to implement bigfoot on top of this. The first step is to download the project from the <a href="http://bigfootjs.com/">website</a> into your Camel file system. Although they can be put together into one file I chose to separate the bigfoot CSS from my site CSS <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="c">&lt;!-- Stylesheets --&gt;</span> 
<span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/css"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"/css/site.css"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/css"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"/css/bigfoot.css"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next, I downloaded jQuery from the <a href="http://jquery.com/download/">official website</a>. Once it was downloaded I added it to my file system in a ‘js’ folder, along with the bigfoot resources. The last thing you need to do is add the following anywhere on the page to enable bigfoot:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="c">&lt;!-- jQuery --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/js/jquery/jquery-2.2.3.min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>

<span class="c">&lt;!-- Bigfoot Footnotes --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/js/bigfoot/dist/bigfoot.min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bigfoot</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In order for bigfoot to work, you need to make sure that footnotes resemble something like this in your code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;sup</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"fnref:1"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"#fn:1"</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"footnote"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>1<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Luckily, Camel supports MultiMarkdown which displays footnotes like this. But if you are using a different engine/CMS this may be done differently.</p>

<p>I had to do a <em>lot</em> of tweaking of the CSS to make the footnotes look how I wanted. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Funnily enough that is what took me the longest to figure out, and it still isn’t perfect (CSS gradients are confusing). It’s also worth noting that there are several bigfoot <a href="http://bigfootjs.com/#options">options</a> available to you, each of which are detailed on the website. I wanted to retain the footnotes with anchor links as the bottom of my posts. To do this you can use the actionOriginalFN: “ignore” option. This does exactly what you would think in that it ignores any original footnote markup. This can be added to the bigfoot script tag:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"> <span class="c">&lt;!-- Bigfoot Footnotes --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/js/bigfoot/dist/bigfoot.min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bigfoot</span><span class="p">({</span>
        <span class="na">actionOriginalFN</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"ignore"</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And that’s it! This was an interesting exercise to undertake and I think it makes a big difference to the browsing experience on the website. I may revisit the CSS of the footnotes at a later stage but for now I am happy.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Like this! <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>I changed the name of ‘bigfoot-default.css’ to ‘bigfoot.css’. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>Like a lot of things on this site, they are heavily influenced by <a href="https://marco.org/">Marco.org</a>. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>

  <p>Nice idea from Instapaper. Their web parser must be really impressive. I very rarely come across a website that it can’t parse for reading, and I save a <em>lot</em> of articles. Web design has moved on a lot in the last decade and the number of different languages and frameworks has grown to an almost comical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_frameworks">number</a>, making this task harder and harder. When I was writing my final year project I wrote a fairly basic parser (<a href="https://github.com/colmulhall/FYP-Web-Coding">link</a>) which targeted a small number of websites for news and information on the Phoenix Park in Dublin. The headaches I had trying to parse relevant information even from these relatively simple websites were..painful. It makes sense from Instapapers perspective and everyone elses if they don’t have to write their own.</p>
