  <p>It has to be seriously frustrating for YouTubers like Jon Paula, who make their living on the site, to see their revenue and view count slip year on year despite the the fact that their video production is improving. The changes that Google made to the site in 2013 actually made the site worse in my opinion. Channels all look the same, some comments are weirdly linked to Google+, thumbs up/down on comments basically don’t work, subscription feeds are constantly changing, the list goes on. I didn’t realise that these changes had such a negative effect on creators too.</p>

  <p>I watched the new Top Gear a few days ago. I thought it was decent. It was never going to be as good as what we are used to, but it’s still early days. Chris Evans came across as trying a bit too hard too hard and seemed over excited about everything but to be fair, there was a lot of pressure on him. Matt LeBlanc is well suited to this kind of role - particularly driving segments where his acting skills help. I think he is a great addition, especially to add the Europe vs USA element.</p>

<p>I was surprised that Sabine Schmitz had such a small role in this episode. I’m thinking that Evans and LeBlanc are the hosts, while the others will chip in every now and then with a segment. Probably not a bad idea.</p>

<p>I was never a huge fan of the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car part of the show, and adding off-road sections to the test track has done little to change that. Still, it’s a minor improvement.</p>

<p>There seems to be a trend online to criticize the new series. It seems like it was doomed to bad reviews before it even aired, which I don’t think it deserves. Clarkson and co took a while to get into their stride when they began on Top Gear, so I expect the same here. And anyway if all else fails there is still a little show coming soon to Amazon Prime..</p>
