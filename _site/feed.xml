  &lt;p&gt;Unsatisfied with the English translated section of the Amagasaki ‚Äúaccident‚Äù report I spent hours digging through the Japanese version of the sections relating to mental state of the driver bouncing between different translation tools to try and understand whether the driver had been getting enough sleep. Unable to locate a single definition source of information about Flint Michigan I went over dozens of articles on what lead up to the incident and dug through some textbooks on corrosion control techniques to understand what actually happened to the water supply. Unhappy with the popular documentary on BP Texas, I went through the multi-hundred page report and the Chemical Safety Board depiction of the event and stripped out the details that made the most sense as the root causes. That‚Äôs just three examples that come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;USB-C represents the dream of a single, small, reversible connector that works with every device, and it‚Äôs being adopted by the entire tech industry. USB-C isn‚Äôt as small as Lightning but it‚Äôs small enough. More importantly, it‚Äôd allow users to use one connector for everything; USB-A, while universal on desktop computers, never achieved ubiquity because it wasn‚Äôt suited for mobile devices. USB-C is.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Conversely, Lightning is under Apple‚Äôs control and Apple likes the idea of controlling their stack as much as possible (for many different reasons). A transition to USB-C would be costly for users in the short term, and it would be extremely perplexing the year after the iPhone 7 fully embraced Lightning.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, unlike the transition from 30-pin to Lightning in 2012, Apple now has a richer, more lucrative ecosystem of accessories and devices based on Lightning, from AirPods and Apple Pencil to keyboards, mice, EarPods, game controllers, Siri remotes, and more. Moving away from Lightning means transitioning several product lines to a standard that Apple doesn‚Äôt own. It means additional inconsistency across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good summary from Federico Viticci about the arguments for and against moving to USB-C in the next iPhone. The arguments for moving are obvious, but the arguments against it are a bit more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs definitely more of an argument to be made for moving to USB-C than there was for ditching the headphone jack. It would also mean that the lifespan of the Lightning connector has been very short. There are plenty of people still using an iPhone 4/4S or iPad 2s - and those people will have completely missed the switch to Lightning.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Colm Mulhall</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="apple" /><category term="usb" /><summary type="html">Federico Viticci on the potential move from Lightning to USB-C:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">N.O.V.A.

Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù. This was as close as you could get to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved&quot;&gt;Halo&lt;/a&gt; on mobile, and for it‚Äôs time &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it was a huge achievement in mobile gaming. It had an in depth story set across multiple maps, different weapons and enemies as well as local and online multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/2/nova1.png&quot; alt=&quot;NOVA&quot; class=&quot;image-single&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Avoiding snipers in &quot;The Mirror, The Ghost and The Gambit&quot;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gameloft followed up with two sequels for NOVA, as well as producing another great first person series alongside it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Combat_(series)&quot;&gt;Modern Combat&lt;/a&gt;, which is more of a Call of Duty clone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gameloft have now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gameloft.com/central/n-o-v-a/nova-story-retrospective-part-1/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that they are releasing a remastered version of the original NOVA game, which will be free to play. This has sparked a debate over on AppSpy about the value in re-releasing mobile games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appspy.com/feature/11158/the-monday-musing-is-nova-legacy-a-step-in-the-wrong-direction-for-mobile&quot;&gt;Harry Slater&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The question all of this raises is an interesting one¬ñ is this really something we want to see on the App Store? Not just NOVA, but the whole concept of older games getting new leases of life. And I guess there are two standpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On the one hand the App Store is a flighty and changeable place. We‚Äôve seen games disappear without trace, and thanks to Apple‚Äôs constant upgrading of iOS, there‚Äôs little chance that we‚Äôre ever going to get to play those games again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From that point of view, it‚Äôs good to see developers going back to games and refreshing them for a new era. Especially the likes of NOVA, which in its time was a resource-heavy AAA production, but now looks a little bit on the wonky side.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But on the flip side of that, is this just another example of the creative malaise that‚Äôs sweeping through gaming as a whole. It‚Äôs not just another dude shooter, it‚Äôs a dude shooter that we‚Äôve all already shot a whole bunch of dudes in before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent I agree with this standpoint. I don‚Äôt see much value in re-releasing games that were only released a few years ago on iOS. What has worked really well, and I hope to see more of, is when console games get ported to mobile. Rockstar Games are making this biggest success of this with their &lt;a href=&quot;http://colm.io/2016/12/08/bully-coming-to-mobile/&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; of some console classics, most notably the Grand Theft Auto series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that‚Äôs where these kind of remasters make most sense - bringing them to mobile for the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; time. Having said that, I can‚Äôt but be happy to see an App Store classic like NOVA being re-released in all its glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The biggest problem for the iPad is Apple‚Äôs unwillingness to let it become its own thing. Development of iOS is driven by the iPhone, which probably shouldn‚Äôt have the tools of a regular computer. But the iPad needs at least some of those tools if it‚Äôs to fulfill Apple‚Äôs promise to be a laptop replacement. Being yoked to the iPhone is holding it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some good points by Dr Drang about the use of the iPad vs the Mac for getting work done. The single biggest thing holding the iPad back is software. The iPad has been around since 2010, and shipped with iOS 3. Fast forward to 2017, and the iPad has been though &lt;em&gt;seven&lt;/em&gt; major iOS releases. Of those, only one has brought real iPad-focused features - iOS 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs understandable that the iPhone has been taking priority over the iPad in terms of developing iOS, but it‚Äôs time for Apple to start making good of its promise that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPYW6Ipgok&quot;&gt;iPad is a replacement for the PC&lt;/a&gt;. It needs the basics - drag and drop, system wide multitasking, a better solution to the home screen, windows &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and a visible file system. Over reliance on the like of &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/&quot;&gt;Workflow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/zapbook/iphone/&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt; just wont cut it for most people who want to make the transition from PC to tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as the iPad is treated as a fork of iOS to the iPhone, it‚Äôs never going to be become a PC replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

What this is, is basically a mode to put your watch on while at the cinema to mute notifications and avoid waking the screen automatically. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There has been plenty of reports to suggest that Theatre Mode will be introduced on iOS this year too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it‚Äôs definitely a nice feature, even if a little bit niche &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I hope that it isn‚Äôt Apples only attempt at a dark mode this year. I‚Äôve long been anticipating a system wide dark mode on iOS, and Theatre Mode seems like a logical step towards it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt expect dark mode to show up in any of the iOS 10.3 builds over the next few weeks. If it‚Äôs to be introduced this year it will presumably be with iOS 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I think would be great would be to have the option to automatically enable dark mode at certain times of the day, similar to how you can enable &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-ios-9-3-night-shift-mode/&quot;&gt;Night Shift&lt;/a&gt; between certain times, or for it to be able to detect the level of light that you have and enable/disable based on that.&lt;/p&gt;
