&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony, along with author Declan Lynch, recently released a book,  ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Tony 10: The astonishing story of the postman who gambled ¬Ä‚Ç¨10,000,000‚Ä¶ and lost it all&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù, documenting his story from falling into gambling addiction to eventually overcoming it and becoming an addiction counsellor himself - not before spending time in jail and losing just about everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book opens by painting a picture of an ordinary man in an ordinary town. What begins with a ¬Ä‚Ç¨1 bet ‚Äúto have an interest‚Äù in some of the 1998 World Cup matches escalates into a world where numbers have no meaning. ¬Ä‚Ç¨10000 on a tennis match, ¬Ä‚Ç¨20000 on a horse may as well be ‚Ç¨¬Ä1 or ‚Ç¨¬Ä2 bets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big take away from reading the book is that it is extremely easy to get sucked into gambling addiction. Betting shops are in every town in Ireland and online betting is available to anybody at any place and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that Tony O‚ÄôReilly was able to walk into betting offices with enormous amounts of money in cash and could bet that money away day after day without any questions being asked makes you wonder how often this type of thing happens, and how betting organizations are getting away with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony 10 is an interesting read, and one which gives a great insight into the power of addiction and how easy it is to lose the run of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Developer Steve Troughton Smith today tweeted photos of macOS 10.14 with some very juicy details about Apple‚Äôs upcoming operating system. The OS is very clearly sporting a fresh new dark theme, presumably a toggle-able setting, with the dark UI affecting all application chrome. You can also see an icon for a Mac News app in the Dock, as well as a first look at Xcode 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More often than not, I write articles for this site after reading something someone else wrote. I browse the web for articles and tweets that I find interesting, and the ones that make me think are very often the ones that inspire me to write something myself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This leads to a funny situation as a writer though: do I write my article as a brand new post that gives the impression I thought of something in a vacuum? Do I write a normal post and link to the article/tweet that inspired me inline? Do I do a full block quote that shows off what idea got me going and write from there?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I personally love the third option. Link to someone else, provide a relatively short block quote of what idea set me off, and then take on the topic from there.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The web allows us to create content that is connected with the rest of the web. Everything we do, especially us writers, is kicked off by something someone else said, and we should embrace that. Make your blog a part of a conversation, not an island that feels like you‚Äôre just doing this all on your own. None of us are, and we should be proud of that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Besides, if someone reads my site and I link somewhere else, hopefully that will make people click that link and some of them will discover a new writer they had never heard of. If that linked article also links somewhere else, then the rabbit hole can get very deep, but that‚Äôs just more chances to find some gems out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couldn‚Äôt agree more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Colm Mulhall</name></author><category term="Blogging" /><category term="blog" /><category term="linked" /><summary type="html">Matt Birchler, on why he loves writing linked posts on his site:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Blogging System Rewrite</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/04/15/blogging-system-rewrite/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blogging System Rewrite" /><published>2018-04-15T11:59:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-04-15T11:59:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/04/15/blogging-system-rewrite</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/04/15/blogging-system-rewrite/">&lt;p&gt;Brent Simmons, describing the recent changes he has made to his blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I realized that I want my blog to be me on the web. This used to be true, but then along came Twitter, and then my presence got split up between two places.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To make this work, I needed two things that my old system from 2009 didn‚Äôt provide:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Title-less posts, and&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The ability to run the site generator on my server, not just on my Mac.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In other words, I needed to be able to write tweet-like posts with no title ‚Äî while on the go, on my iPhone or iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs interesting to see the influence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;Micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; has had on the blogging community. I‚Äôm seeing more and more of this style of posting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogs set up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging&quot;&gt;microblogging&lt;/a&gt; are interesting to read. It‚Äôs like having a Twitter feed with occasional long form blog posts sandwiched in-between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to cross post to social media ensures that you can keep your output under your control, as it always lives on your own site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not something I see myself setting up as I don‚Äôt really post enough on social media to justify it, but it‚Äôs a smart move for anyone concerned with &lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/2011/07/11/own-your-identity&quot;&gt;owning their own identify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Colm Mulhall</name></author><category term="Blogging" /><category term="micro.blog" /><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Brent Simmons, describing the recent changes he has made to his blog:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How the new 9.7-inch iPad stacks up against the iPad Pro</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/04/06/new-ipad/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How the new 9.7-inch iPad stacks up against the iPad Pro" /><published>2018-04-06T11:40:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-04-06T11:40:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/04/06/new-ipad</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/04/06/new-ipad/">&lt;p&gt;Nice comparison on 9to5mac between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17188626/apple-ipad-review-pencil-processor-2018-education&quot;&gt;new 9.7-inch&lt;/a&gt; iPad and the iPad Pro line. That new iPad at ‚Ç¨369.99 is a great buy. The only real downside between it an the Pro line is the screen, which lacks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/ie/newsroom/2017/06/ipad-pro-10-5-and-12-9-inch-models-introduces-worlds-most-advanced-display-breakthrough-performance/&quot;&gt;ProMotion and True Tone&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p&gt;On the surface, Diamonds Are Forever is a terrible film. It marked Connery‚Äôs comeback, after a four year absence, and unfortunately he no longer seemed to fit the role. By then, he was a little pudgier, less dynamic, and he often looked bored on screen. Perhaps Connery was attempting to play off the film‚Äôs overall tone. Diamonds was the first Bond film to delve into camp and comedy. The results would appear mixed, at best. Though the film has received its share of positive reviews over the years, it is mostly ranked in the ‚Äúbottom tier‚Äù on critics‚Äô and fans‚Äô Bond lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Bond films are so different that is hard to believe they are part of the same franchise at all. If you were to compare &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066995/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diamonds Are Forever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064757/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Her Majesty‚Äôs Secret Service&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which came out just two years beforehand) you would be hard pushed to find any similarities at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I enjoy Daniel Craig‚Äôs more gritty and realistic portrayal of the character, I always find myself leaning towards Roger Moore‚Äôs Bonds when I just want to sit down and be entertained. The same goes for &lt;em&gt;Diamonds Are Forever&lt;/em&gt; as outlined in the linked article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shouldn‚Äôt work, and to the majority of people it doesn‚Äôt work, but I really enjoy Bond movies that don‚Äôt take themselves too seriously. What Bond films have I seen most? Probably &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079574/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moonraker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071807/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Man With The Golden Gun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - both of which are consistently ranked at or near the bottom of the Bond films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs what‚Äôs great about the Bonds. Some people can‚Äôt stand Roger Moore. Some people think Timothy Dalton is the unsung hero. Others think anything before Daniel Craig‚Äôs films can be disregarded. There‚Äôs something for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Colm Mulhall</name></author><category term="Entertainment" /><category term="Bond" /><summary type="html">On the surface, Diamonds Are Forever is a terrible film.

&lt;p&gt;Most of what I write on this site are small, linked posts, but for longer posts there are some great pieces of information that I can take from David‚Äôs workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools for the job are another story that mostly comes down to personal preference. I use a combination of text editors to write my posts, most of which depend on the device I‚Äôm using.

  &lt;p&gt;Your posts are just a normal, everyday part of the open web. At this writing, mine appear on micro.inessential.com ‚Äî but it‚Äôs on my to-do list to have those appear on my main blog (this blog) instead. (Probably won‚Äôt happen until after I ship the app I‚Äôm currently working on.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And this is how it used to be, and how it never should have stopped being: my blog is me on the web. I own my blog: I own me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And so everyone who follows me on Micro.blog sees my blog posts, and I see theirs. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And anyone who wants to could just read my blog in an RSS reader instead. All good, all open.&lt;/p&gt;
