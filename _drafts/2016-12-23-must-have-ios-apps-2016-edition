Federico Viticci just posted his annual "must have iOS apps" article on Macstories detailing his favourite apps in certain categories. I [wrote about][2015edition] last years article and compared which apps also feel into my list of favourites. So more of the same:

<a id="dropbox"></a>

#### Dropbox 
I wouldn't go as far as to say this is one of my favourite apps, but Dropbox is an essential service for online storage, and still my favourite of the lot. Google Drive comes in at a close second, but so far nothing can beat Dropbox to the top. The app is simple, yet stable and receives regular updates.

<a id="1password"></a>

#### 1Password 
I said last year that I would be lost without 1Password, and nothing has changed this year. I still add a new passowrd to it regularly. THe app is one of the most actively updated in this list as well, which is a bit crazy seeing as what it does is relatively simple. I can't recommend it enough. 

<a id="workflow"></a>

#### Workflow
I only recently downloaded Workflow to try it out, so I'm only scratching the surface of what it's capable of, but what an application it is. Something as simple as opening your current location in a Google Street View image in a single tap, or adding a reminder from the widgets screen are built right into Workflow. It even has its own Workflow Store where people can submit Workflows that they created and others can download them. I think it's the most exciting app to hit iOS since its launch based on the sheer number of possibilities alone. There's a lot more to discover with it.
