Despite the fact that we [knew the details][leaks] of the majority of products that Apple were planning to announce, there is still a _lot_ to talk about from Apple's September event. 

Apple Watch enthusiasts finally got one of their most requested features - cellular data,  Apple TV enthusiasts (or whatever subset of them have a TV capable of driving 4K) got a nice upgrade, and general Apple enthusiasts got to see a shiny new campus. 

For me, the main thing I was interested in seeing was the new iPhones.

## iPhone 8/8 Plus
Confusingly named '8' and '8 Plus' don't let that fool you into thinking these are anything other than an iPhone '7s' and '7s Plus'. That being said, both phones are nice upgrades, particularly for owners of iPhone 6s or older.  

For the first time since the iPhone 4S, the glass back returns and I'm glad it has. Aestetics aside, this apparantly enables the iPhone 8's to support wireless charging, which is something that I think will be great once it becomes widely supported in restaurants, airports etc. 

It's great to see that the 8's have got the same chip as the iPhone X, the A11 'Bionic', promising speeds up to 70% faster than the previous generation. The camera has also got it's usual bump. 

The other notable hardware bumps are

## iPhone X
