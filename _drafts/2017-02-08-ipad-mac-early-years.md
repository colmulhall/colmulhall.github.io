But the iPad needs at least some of those tools if it’s to fulfill Apple’s promise to be a laptop replacement. Being yoked to the iPhone is holding it back.

Some good points by Dr Drang about the use of the iPad vs the Mac for getting work done. The single biggest thing holding the iPad back is software.

As long as the iPad is seen as a fork of iOS to the iPhone, it's never going to be seen as a full on PC replacement.
