Back in 2009, Gameloft released a a first person shooter game on iOS called "[N.O.V.A. Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance][novawiki]". This was as close as you could get to [Halo][halowiki] on mobile, and for it's time [^1] it was a huge achievement in mobile gaming. It had an in depth story set across multiple maps, different weapons and enemies as well as local and online multiplayer. 

Gameloft followed up with two sequals for NOVA, as well as producing another great first person series alongside it, Modern Combat (which is more of a Call of Duty clone). 

Gameloft have now announced that they are releasing a remastered version of the original NOVA game, which will be free to play.

[^1]:Bearing in mind that this was still barely over a year into the life of the App Store, and iOS had only just learned the complex task of cut, copy and paste.
