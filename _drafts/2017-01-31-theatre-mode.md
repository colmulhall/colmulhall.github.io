With WatchOS 3.2 it looks like Apple are introducing "Theatre Mode" to the Apple Watch. What this is, is basically a mode to put your watch on while at the cinema to mute notifications and avoid waking the screen automatically. [^1] There has been plenty of reports to suggest that Theatre Mode will be introduced on iOS this year too. 

While it's definitely a nice feature, even if a little bit too niche [2], I hope that it isn't Apples only attempt at a dark mode this year. I've long been anticipating a system wide dark mode on iOS. 

[^1]: 9to5mac have published a good [overview][95tm] of Theatre Mode on WatchOS with an accompanying video. 
[^2]: And does it really warrant a place in Control Center? Surely this year will finally be the year that Apple allows us to customize the setting available to toggle in Control Center.
