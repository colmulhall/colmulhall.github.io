You have to hand it to Apple. This has been their best year yet - by a comfortable margin - when it comes to keeping leaks to a minimum. Previous years, we have basically known each and every new feature of iOS with maybe one or two reasonably big surprises. It's testament to the MacStories team (and Apple) that their [concept video][iosconcept] of iOS 11 on iPad has proved to be the most accurate pre-WWDC article regarding iOS 11.

Control Center has finally got the update that we've all been [waiting][controlcenter] [for][controlcenter2]: customization. For me, this is the biggest change that iOS 11 will bring to iPhone, in what is clearly an iPad focused update.
