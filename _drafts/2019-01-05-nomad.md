Following on from 2011's brilliant "I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan", "Alan Partridge: Nomad" follows Alan on a journey in the footsteps of his late father, from Norwich to Dungeness A nuclear reactor by foot [^1]. 

The book is written in typical Partridge style, focusing in on the most mundane things you could think of, such as a visit to the London Container Terminal in Essex, the M20 motorway and Gatwick Airport. 

Along the journey, Alan takes several detours which he attempts to defend as necessary, but which are clearly being used as a way of enhancing his career. He also frequently only manages to cover a fraction of the distance that he had aimed to each day, and spends most nights in a local B&B, usually leaving a poor review on TripAdvisor the following day.


**Highlight**: A chapter dedicated to explaining the various reasons why Alan hates Noel Edmonds. 

[^1]: That plot would sound strange if it wasn't for the fact that this is a book about Alan Partridge.
