Stephen Hackett reflects on the Apple Watch a few months on from his [initial review][512awr]. His summary of how he has started to lose interest in the watch confirms some of my initial worries about it. At no point in my day at work would I feel the need to access notifications on my wrist. If anything, the watch would just act as a distraction.

I would like to have notifications or the ability to play/pause media while on the move without having to take out my phone, but if this is my only use for the watch then I don't think it's worth looking into any time soon.
