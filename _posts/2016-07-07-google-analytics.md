I had been looking for some way of tracking activity on this site for a while, and not for the first time Google have answered the call. Google Analytics provides insights on just about everything - from what device the user is viewing your site on to how long they spend on each page and even their screen resolution. It's also free, and ridiculously easy to set up. [Check it out][ga].
