What a ridiculously successful four years Volkwagen had in the World Rally Championship. 

The highlights:

* 43 wins in 52 rallies
* Topped the Drivers’ and Co-Drivers’ Championship for an uninterrupted 986 days
* Topped Manufacturers’ standings for 1346 days in a row
* Won 12 rallies in a row on *two* seperate occasions

It's a shame to see a team that are so dominant leave the WRC based on [other issues][scandal] with the company. It will be a real test for Sébastien Ogier next season to retain his title with a different car and team behind him for the first time.
