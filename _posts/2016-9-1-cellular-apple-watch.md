Stephen Hackett on the possibility of a cellular Apple Watch:

>Assuming it doesn’t cost me another $30/month for service, I’d be very interested in having my Watch be able to talk to a cellular network when I go out for a ride. Until then, my iPhone will be tucked in my back pocket.

I've [talked][watch] here before about how, in it's current state, I wouldn't find the Watch useful. If cellular data was to be added it it would make the Watch a lot more appealing to me. The idea of being able to go to go outside without having my phone would be a good enough reason in itself to buy one.
