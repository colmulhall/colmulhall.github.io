Ten years ago yesterday, the iPhone first went on sale. It's hard to believe it's been that long, and even harder to think of a world without a smartphone in your pocket. Here's some of the many write ups:

* "[Perfect Ten][df]" - Daring Fireball
* "[The iPhone at 10: Into the woods][sc]" - Six Colors
* "[iPhone: A Decadeâ€™s Worth of Impact][5p]" - 512 Pixels
* "[10 years with iPhone][ms]" - MacSparky
* "[Happy 10th anniversary to the iPhone][95]" - 9to5mac
