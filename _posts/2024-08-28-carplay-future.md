>There was a brief shining moment where it seemed like Apple might really have cracked the automotive industry–it wasn’t necessarily for the reasons you might think. Yes, the company tried hard for years to build its own car in a variety of ways, everything from designing the underlying automotive systems to building the whole thing from the ground up.

The company announced a next-generation push that can use all of a car’s displays, with an interface tailored to each specific maker, but it’s been slow to garner adoption amongst its partners.

Easily one of my favourite iOS features. I wouldn't buy a car without support for it. 

There definitely is a question over its long term future as car companies are now putting more focus on their infotainment systems and will be reluctant to hand over control to external companies like Apple and Google.

I hope there will always be a place for CarPlay among that.
