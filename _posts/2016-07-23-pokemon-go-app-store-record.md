The Loop:

>With all of the press it’s received in the past couple of weeks, it will come as no surprise that Pokemon Go has been a huge success. In fact, Apple told me today that the game has set a new App Store record with more downloads in its first week than any other app in history.

Although no actual numbers were mentioned by Apple, that is seriously impressive, even if it's not entirely surprising. The real question from Nintendo's perspective is how many people who downloaded Pokémon Go will still be playing it in six months time. I've been trying it out for the past week or so and while it's definitely addictive and brings back a lot of [memories][pokered], it doesn't take long to grow tired of having to have your phone in your hand while walking, or having to take detours that you wouldn't usually take.

Pokémon Go could end up similar to the [Wii][wiiwiki], where the novelty of movement while gaming soon grew old and people went back to the comfort couch gaming. I hope I'm wrong.
