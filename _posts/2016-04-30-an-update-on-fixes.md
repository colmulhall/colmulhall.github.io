Earlier this month I [posted][colmiofix] about what issues I was having with the website, and what I wanted to fix. Here is an update on these:

- 'Previous' and 'Newer' links are now where they are supposed to be, with the exception of the final page
- Favicon got updated ✔
- Bigfoot footnotes are [now supported][bgft] ✔
- Support for Safari Reader ✔
- RSS entries are still duplicating, but not when using the alternative feed. Still needs investigating..
- Decided to stick with the same font ✔
- Responsiveness still needs working on
