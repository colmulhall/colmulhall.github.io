An interesting report from Bloomberg on Apple's plans for the rest of 2019 and onto 2020. We are at the point where it's getting harder and harder to make meaningful updates to smartphones year after year, or at least meaningful enough to convince people to upgrade. 

Focussing on camera improvements is not exactly a new tactic from Apple, but it is something that is always appreciated when upgrading. 

I'm particularly interested in what the 2019 iPhones will bring to the table:

> For 2019, Apple plans successors to the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max -- code-named D42 and D43 -- and an update to the iPhone XR, said the people. The larger of the new high-end iPhones will have three cameras on the back, and other handsets could eventually come with the upgraded system, too, the people said.

> A third camera on the back of the 2019 iPhone will help the device capture a larger field of view and enable a wider range of zoom. It will also capture more pixels so Apple software could, for example, automatically repair a video or photo to fit in a subject that may have been accidentally cut off from the initial shot, according to the people familiar with the plans. The company is also planning an enhanced version of its Live Photos feature, which pins video from before and after each shot to the photo. The new version will double the length of the video from three seconds to six seconds.

> This year’s iPhone models will include an upgraded Apple processor and use an updated Face ID sensor for unlocking the device and approving payments, the people said.

Bloomberg are also reporting that iOS 13 will include dark mode, something which I have wanted for a long time:

> Apple’s next operating system update, iOS 13, will include a dark mode option for easier nighttime viewing and improvements to CarPlay, the company’s in-vehicle software. There will also be iPad-specific upgrades like a new home screen, the ability to tab through multiple versions of a single app like pages in a web browser, and improvements to file management.
