I'll eventually get around to fixing these issues with the site, but that day is not today:

- <s>'Older' and 'Newer' links between pages should be either side of the page, not together</s>
- <s>Favicon needs updating to make it less crap</s>
- <s>Support for [bigfoot][bgft] footnotes</s>
- Support for Safari Reader 
- Fix issue where RSS entries are duplicating
- Unified font between different OS's
- Responsivness fix for small tablet sizes`

It's times like this that I'm glad I didn't write the engine myself!
