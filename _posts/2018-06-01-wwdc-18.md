WWDC 2018 kicks off in San Jose on Monday 4th. iOS 12 should be light on new features, instead bringing some much-needed stability to the platform, which is fine by me. Siri should also see some stage time with meaningful improvements. Hardware wise, it's anyone's guess.

I have one wish, and one wish only (which I've had the [previous][wwdc16] [two][wwdc17] years)....system wide dark mode. Don't let me down Apple. üôè
