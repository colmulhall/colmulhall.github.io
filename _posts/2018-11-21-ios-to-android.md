An interesting [post][speirs] from Fraser Speirs about his reasoning from switching from iOS to Android recently. The main reason for this is cost, unsuprisingly. Like most of us, Frasers main use of his phone was to check social media, YouTube and Google Maps. That does beg the question of why people (myself included) buy brand new, expensive phones every year or two. 

For me it's a mix of ecosystem and preference. I could switch to a cheaper Android model any time with no loss of functionality, but I enjoy using iOS. That may change at some point in the future if Apple continue to price up the iPhone, but for now I feel like I'm making a worthy investment in sticking with Apple. 

I'm interested to see how Fraser finds the switch after a longer period of time has passed.
