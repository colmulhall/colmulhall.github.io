Following on from his previous post on [switching from iOS to Android][ioad], Fraser Speirs details why he moved from a iPad/MacBook setup to a Google Pixelbook. The majority of his work centering around using [G Suite][gsuite] makes it an easy decision for him. 

Traditionally, Google has had a bad [track record][slowgoogle] for implementing features in it's iOS apps. This, coupled with the cost of having to juggle a MacBook and an iPad, have pushed Fraser to move over to an all Google setup. 

Google is a long way ahead in services in my opinion. Google Maps, Docs, Drive and News are applications that I use on a daily basis, and Apple have yet to come close to challenging them with their equivalent services. That's a gap that's only going to get harder and harder to fill for Apple.
