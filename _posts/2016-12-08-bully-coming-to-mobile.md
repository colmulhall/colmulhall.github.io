>I'm really not sure what else there is to say about Bully. The game, when it was originally released, scored an impressive 87 on Metacritic, and it's only gotten better over the years with the various visual improvements and minor gameplay additions. If you missed Bully when it was first released on the PlayStation 2, then skipped it again when it was re-released on other platforms, don't miss this new re-remastered iteration. Hell, I'd say the entirety of the Rockstar iOS catalog is worth owning, and Bully: Anniversary Edition is no different.

Continuing with their tradition of releasing past console classics on mobile around Christmas, usually on the 10 year anniversary of the games, Rockstar are now releasing "Bully" on iOS and Android. I loved this game when I first played it on PS2 (it was known as "Canis Canem Edit" in PAL regions), so I'm expecting much of the same on mobile. 

To date, Rockstar have ported:
* Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, 2010
* Grand Theft Auto III, 2011
* Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, 2012
* Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, 2013
* Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, 2015
