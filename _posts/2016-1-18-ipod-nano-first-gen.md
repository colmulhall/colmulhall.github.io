Interesting round up of the different generations of the iPod nano through the years. The first generation iPod nano was the first Apple device I owned. I got it back in 2006 in a 1Gb form. I remember at the time I couldn't believe how thin it was and how easy it was to use. It has aged very well. I still use it from time to time, despite the pain of loading songs from iTunes.
