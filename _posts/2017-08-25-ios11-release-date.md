| iOS 10      | 13th September 2016 | Tuesday         |

From iOS 5 onwards there is an obvious trend - midweek release in the third week of September. Based on that, and the move to Tuesday last year, I will go with **Tuesday, September 12th** as the release date for iOS 11.

*Update* - I was a week off. iOS 11 releases to the public on the [19th September][release11].
