Nice overview of Dark Mode in macOS Mojave. After reading through this it makes me even more happy to see a dark mode introduced. 

Aside from looking great, I find darker colours much easier on the eye, which is something to be aware of when spending long periods of time working at a computer. Hopefully it makes its way onto iOS in the future.
