The career of Tiger Woods has one of the most interesting sporting stories of all time. 

Written by Jeff Benjamin and Armen Keteyian, _Tiger Woods_ is a biography of the golfer from when he was born until the end of 2018, when he had come back from numerous scandals and injuries to win again on the PGA Tour. [^1]

What surprised me most was Woods early life, where he was effectively brainwashed into golf from the age of two, watching his father his shots for hours on end. Not only was he learning his craft from an extremely young age, he was also learning how to play like an 'assassin', to not only beat his opponents but to beat them by as much as he could. It's clear to see how he became so dominant in the sport. 

The cost of that level of success at such a young age was that he never really had a normal life, which was a big factor in the scandal that broke in 2009.

Any sport fan would enjoy this book, whether or not they follow golf. Well worth a read.

**Highlight**: The period of 2000-2007 when Woods was untouchable on the tour.

[^1]:It's a shame that the book came out not long before Woods won the 2019 Masters.
