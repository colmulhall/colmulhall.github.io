Manton Reece is creating an interesting new social network based around blogging and owning your own content called "Micro.blog". The idea is fairly simple - you can host your own blog right on Micro.blog, or you can simply use your RSS feed as an input, therefore keeping total control of your content. 

The great thing about this is that it can bring you a new audience and allow you to join conversations about other blogs all in one place. It's like an RSS reader with social integration.

A big problem with social media is that you never truly own your content. Most services allow you to export your data at any time, so that in the event that the  platform shuts down you can hold onto your content. The great thing about Micro.blog is that you never have to give up any of your content in the first place, whether or not it lasts as a platform.

Judging by the support on the Micro.blog [Kickstarter page][kick], we could be seeing it sooner rather than later.
