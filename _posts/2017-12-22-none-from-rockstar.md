TouchArcade are reporting that for the first time in a [number of years][rockstars], there will be no iOS release from Rockstar this Christmas. It's become a bit of a tradition for Rockstar to port old console games to iOS at this time of year, and I've enjoyed playing them over previous Christmas holidays. It's a pity we won't be getting anything this year, but hopefully there's plenty more to come from Rockstar in 2018.
