>macOS sierra is coming Thursday. Here’s where you should install it:

> * Nowhere, if you aren’t willing to constantly back up all your data and take the risks of having an unstable Mac in your life for a few months
> * Nowhere, if you aren’t willing to use the Feedback Assistant app to report to Apple about the bugs you’re finding

>iOS 10 beta is also due today. Here’s where you should install it:

> * Not on your main iPhone
> * Not on your main iPad
> * On an iOS device that you don’t rely on

I made the mistake of trying out the public betas in the past and each time I regretted it. It's not worth getting an early look at what's new when you sacrifice performance and battery life. At the very least I would wait until the second public beta is released for both.
