[Parasite][parasite] is the best film I've seen in a long time. 

It's somehow equally funny, thrilling and tragic, while carrying a message about class levels and the gap between the haves and have-nots. None of this should be a surprise when you look at the list of [awards it received][awards]. For a non English language film to win four Oscars takes some doing.

I came across [this review][review] of Parasite on Letterboxd, which is the perfect post-film read.
