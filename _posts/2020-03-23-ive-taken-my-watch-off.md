Chris Hannah, on the Apple Watch:

>I haven't worn my Apple Watch in about two weeks. There was no big decision when I stopped wearing it, but I've noticed that over the past month or so, I would just be less bothered about wearing it.

>No music/podcasts are being controlled on the watch anymore, because I have AirPods that can do that. I don't track workouts because they were never real workouts anyway. I don't play Field Day or PokÃ©mon GO anymore. And if I want to check anything like the weather, football scores, text messages, I just take my phone out of my pocket.

>I've started to actually like not having my wrist being the interface between myself and the internet. And I've grown tired about being notified about things that I just don't care about.

It's interesting to see how people use the Watch in their day to day. Chris has worn a watch for a number of years and is beginning to find it less useful in recent times. 

Since the Watch launched I was always a bit [skeptical][watchthoughts] of some of the features, particularly ones related to notifications. I'm far too addicted to my phone as it is, so having a device physically attached to me that opens up more possibilities of staring into a screen never really appealed to me. 

I recently picked up a [Fitbit Charge 3][fitbit] to help me track my fitness and heart rate [^1]. Having this information has renewed my interest in the Apple Watch, but I have to remind myself that there is a big difference between a _fitness tracker_ and a _smartwatch_. [Matt Gemmell][mattwatch] wrote a piece a few years back on moving away from the Apple Watch and back to a Fitbit. Similarly, David Smith wrote [this article][lowendwatch] on his hopes for a more fitness focused Apple Watch.

I'm going to see just how useful I find the Fitbit in the coming months and whether or not I like wearing a watch full time. If I find myself wanting a bit more from it I may look into the Apple Watch or more functional Fitbits.

[^1]: So far I'm really liking it. Great iOS application and excellent battery life.
