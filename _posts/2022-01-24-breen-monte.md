>M-Sport managing director Malcolm Wilson says he made it “very clear” to Craig Breen that his priority on the Monte Carlo Rally was to bring his Ford Puma Rally1 Hybrid to the finish and bank points.

>Wilson said the fact Breen’s trouble-free run was rewarded with a podium made it “absolutely the dream start”.

>“Craig’s done exactly the job that he needed to,” Wilson told DirtFish.

>“He’s going to be our team leader and I was very clear with him, he needed to get some points on the board.

>“To get a podium is absolutely the dream start for him, especially if you see that both Sébastiens [Loeb and runner-up Sébastien Ogier] will probably not be doing the whole championship.”

Rock solid start from Irelands Craig Breen and the M-Sport team. Looks to be an exciting year of WRC ahead.
