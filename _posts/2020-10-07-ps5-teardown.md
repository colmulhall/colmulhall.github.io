>It’s getting close to November, and we are very excited for the launch of PlayStation 5 console. Today, we wanted to give you a sneak peek at the console’s interior, so you can take a look at all of the magic happening inside the PS5 that brings out the beautiful games you’ll experience this holiday season.

Whatever about the interior, the exterior of the PS5 is _huge_. I don't usually prefer the slim versions of PlayStations, but that could be the case this time.
