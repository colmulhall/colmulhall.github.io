Better late than never, here are some things I hope Apple announce later today:

- Universal dark mode on iOS and OS X
- Enhanced iPad multitasking with a better app picker
- Siri API
- Siri for Mac
- Customizable Control Center
- Xcode for iPad [^1]

Here are some others: [512 Pixels][512wwdc], [Six Colors][6cwwdc], [9to5mac][925wwdc]

[^1]: Highly unlikely I think, but even a very basic version would be a start.
