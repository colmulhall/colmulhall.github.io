Anthony Karcz:

>iOS 14 has been an eventful beta so far, but overall it's surprisingly stable. Not everything works the way it should, yet, but that's to be expected. Even though they're a bit of a pain, I've really enjoyed the new widgets. In fact, I like them so much, I've completely blown away my carefully arranged Home screen and replaced it all with widgets! I'll talk about that more next week.

>I don't recommend installing iOS 14 on your main device (and if you do read my guide first). If you do, expect instability and partial functionality from core apps until late in August. Even then, at least one of the keynote features will likely be delayed or disappear altogether. Early betas are notorious for culling weak-performing features. 

As with all iOS betas, it's a good idea to avoid them if you can.
