I'm terrible when it comes to design and fashion, or anything even remotely related to them. So when it comes to making changes around those areas, I am a little...uneasy. 

I recently made slight changes to the appearance of the blog. This is something I imagine I will do fairly regularly as it evolves, until I'm happy with a particular design [^1]. The main change I wanted to try out was a darker background. I'm a big fan of dark themes in software applications. They are easier on the eye, and in my opinion they just *look* better. For that reason, I wanted to try out a dark background. It may not be to everyones taste but I wanted to see if it holds up after a couple of weeks of use. 

I recently came across an article by Matt Gemmell from a few years back entitled "[Designing blogs for readers][gemdesign]". In it, he details how the design of his own blog has evolved through the previous decade(!), starting out with a cluttered design full of every possible widget known to man, and eventually working it's way to a simple design with the reader in mind. He then goes on to document his own set of guidlelines for blog readibility. Of those, I violate:

- Date-based index pages
- A feed button
- Background textures or colours

These are relatively minor things, and I'm not too bothered about them. I like date indices. I'm in the (presumable) minority in the fact that I regularly use date indexes when visiting blogs that have them. The RSS button on my header is hardly neccesary, but again is pretty useful to have available on each page [^2]. As discussed above, I like darker themes, so having a background colour to me is often seen as a good thing. 

Matt definitely has some great points in his post, but it's ok to put your own stamp on what is essentially *your* website. 

There is still plenty of things that I would like to try out on the site, such as footers, linked lists, recent posts, a logo, more experimentation with blogging engines and publishing with Apple News. That's more than enough to keep me busy. I may end up linking this post sometime in the future to show how right or wrong I was, or how lazy I am for not following up.

[^1]: Bear with me - this could take a while..
[^2]: In the future I may consider adding a footer to the site, which is where I would probably add the RSS link.
