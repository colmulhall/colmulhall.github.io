An interesting post by David Sparks over on MacSparky about the general workflow he uses for publishing on his blog. He treats long form posts as projects which require mind maps, an editor and a most importantly, time.

Most of what I write on this site are small, linked posts, but for longer posts there are some great pieces of information that I can take from David's workflow. 

Tools for the job are another story that mostly comes down to personal preference. I use a combination of text editors to write my posts, most of which depend on the device I'm using. I would love for a built-in Markdown editor to be added to the GitHub file editor, but for now I will continue to use what I always do.

For reference, I use:
* [Sublime Text][st]
* [1Writer][1w]
* [Dillinger][dl]
