>It’s been a long journey, but the conclusion of the story so far is clear to me. macOS is Apple’s friendliest, most powerful platform for power users. Can iPadOS become as intuitive and versatile for power users, even in new, iPad-only ways that I can’t imagine right now?


Interesting article from Federico Viticci on the difference between the Mac and iPad for getting work done. 

As time passes I'm getting less convinced that the iPad will ever get near a PC for professional use. The iPad Pro hardware indicates that there are plans to make the iPad more of a productivity machine than just a casual media device, but maybe expectations need to be more realistic. There is still a place for a traditional PC for getting work done, and probably always will be.
