This book is a bit of a blast from the past. I hadn't read it in a number of years but I'm happy to report that it still brought as much laughs as the first time.

For anyone unfamiliar with the character, Ross O' Carroll-Kelly is an exaggerated fictional south side Dubliner, coming of age in the Celtic Tiger era.

This is one of the early releases in the [long list][rocklist] of 'ROCK' books, and follows Ross through his first year in UCD and his summer in the states afterwards. 

If you're looking for an easy read and some pre-recession laughs, it's worth a read.

**Highlight**: Any interation with Ross and his doting father, affectionately nicknamed 'dick-features'.
