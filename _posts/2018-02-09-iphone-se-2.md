Stephen Hackett, with an interesting outline of a possible new iPhone SE. There has been no confirmation from Apple that they have plans to update the now two year old SE, but I hope they do. The SE is a great choice for people who aren't too bothered about having the latest specs, people who don't want to spend a fortune on a phone, and people who don't want to carry around a big phone. 

I'd imagine that covers a *lot* of people.
