Jared Nelson on TouchArcade:

>A new report from Kotaku states that Rockstar is currently developing a remaster of that 3D trilogy–which includes GTA III, GTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas–and is planning on releasing them on all current and last-gen consoles including the Switch, PC, and mobile devices. Rumors of old GTA games being remastered have run rampant for years now, and the only confirmation we have this time around is Kotaku saying it comes from a source they trust, but the whole idea isn’t really that far-fetched. Bringing them up to speed to run on more modern hardware and, more importantly, be able to be more easily maintained into the future makes a lot of sense given the historical importance of that particular GTA trilogy. Plus those games are still loads of fun.

I'm not sure that I'd care too much about a remaster of these games. I have already played them to death when they were released originally, as well as over the past decade or so that they have been available on mobile. What I'd *love* to see is GTA 4 brought to mobile.
