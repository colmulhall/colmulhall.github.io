>Multitasking can be done the same way as it was before, but there's also a new multitasking menu that streamlines the multitasking experience, offering quick-tap options for entering into Split View or Slide Over with two apps. In the App Switcher view, you can also get into a quick Split View mode by dragging one app's window onto another, which is handy.

Some positive changes to iPad multitasking in iPadOS 15. Not quite 'desktop class' multitasking, but a big improvement.
