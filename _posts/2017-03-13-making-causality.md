[John Chidgey][jctwit] on making his podcast, [Causality][cause]:

>Unsatisfied with the English translated section of the Amagasaki "accident" report I spent hours digging through the Japanese version of the sections relating to mental state of the driver bouncing between different translation tools to try and understand whether the driver had been getting enough sleep. Unable to locate a single definition source of information about Flint Michigan I went over dozens of articles on what lead up to the incident and dug through some textbooks on corrosion control techniques to understand what actually happened to the water supply. Unhappy with the popular documentary on BP Texas, I went through the multi-hundred page report and the Chemical Safety Board depiction of the event and stripped out the details that made the most sense as the root causes. Thatâ€™s just three examples that come to mind.

I had no idea such an amount of work goes into making these episodes.
