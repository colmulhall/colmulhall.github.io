Nice comparison on 9to5mac between the [new 9.7-inch][new97] iPad and the iPad Pro line. That new iPad at €369.99 is a great buy. The only real downside between it an the Pro line is the screen, which lacks [ProMotion and True Tone][displaypro]. Neither of those technologies  are complete deal breakers, but the gap in display quality would definitely be noticable in a side by side comparison. 

The Pro line of iPads are great, but at an entry level price of €749.99 for the 10.5-inch model, I just struggle to see what that extra €380 really gets you. The Pro line will likely see an update this summer so I would expect some new features that should blow the 9.7-inch iPad out of the water, but for sure it's still a great tablet for the price.
