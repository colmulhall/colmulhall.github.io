Just like the iPhone, the iPad has never had naming conventions that have made much sense. The [latest release][newpad] just further confuses things:

* iPad
* iPad 2
* The new iPad (with Retina display, 3rd generation)
* The new iPad (with Retina display, 4th generation)
* iPad Air
* iPad Air 2
* iPad

Not confusing at all. And strangely seems to have just worked its way back to the original naming.
