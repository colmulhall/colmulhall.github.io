Brent Simmons, describing the recent changes he has made to his blog:

> I realized that I want my blog to be me on the web. This used to be true, but then along came Twitter, and then my presence got split up between two places.
> 
>To make this work, I needed two things that my old system from 2009 didn’t provide:
> 
>1. Title-less posts, and
>2. The ability to run the site generator on my server, not just on my Mac.
> 
>In other words, I needed to be able to write tweet-like posts with no title — while on the go, on my iPhone or iPad.

It's interesting to see the influence that [Micro.blog][micro] has had on the blogging community. I'm seeing more and more of this style of posting. 

Blogs set up with [microblogging][mbwiki] are interesting to read. It's like having a Twitter feed with occasional long form blog posts sandwiched in-between. 

The ability to cross post to social media ensures that you can keep your output under your control, as it always lives on your own site. 

This is not something I see myself setting up as I don't really post enough on social media to justify it, but it's a smart move for anyone concerned with [owning their own identify][id].
