>Maybe there are senior developers who have both breadth and depth — they know everything and know it all well — but I suspect that’s the rare case.

>Experience and wisdom count for more than vast technical knowledge. And, in fact, I don’t have that knowledge, except in the few places where I need it. (You couldn’t even call me a Mac power user. Outside the realm of Xcode and app development I use my Mac in the simplest of ways.)

>I know how to get technical knowledge, though. I look things up. I learn. I ask questions. I ask for help. Same as you!
>
>And I find some tools — such as Apple’s for setting up app IDs, certificates, and so on — to be as impenetrable and frustrating as everyone else does.

>Nope. No Jedi here.
