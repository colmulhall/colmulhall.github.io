Another year, another list of favourite apps from Federico Viticci. For the past [two][mh15] [years][mh16], I have written about the apps that Federico highlights as his favourite, that I also find useful. This year, he has compiled an even bigger list of apps than in previous years, so it'll be interesting to see have I picked up any new favourites that fall on this list.

<a id="dropbox"></a>

#### Dropbox 
Between Dropbox and Google Drive, I have all of my important files backed up online. The Dropbox app has seen a steady stream of updates this year which is always welcome, especially with a service tasked with storing your files online. The addition of the Files app on iOS 11 means I use the official Dropbox app less, but it is still useful to have for reference.

<a id="1password"></a>

#### 1Password
1Password is one of those services that'll make you wonder how you got by before using them. All your passwords stored online for reference, quickly accessible from the share sheet on iOS. I would (literally) be lost online without 1Password. An absolutely essential app for anybody to have on their devices.

<a id="spotify"></a>

#### Spotify
I'm not actually a paid subscriber of Spotify, podcasts fit the bill for me over music for the majority of the time, but Spotify is a great service which allows a free account to play a number of songs and listen to ads in between, albeit losing the ability to select their own songs after a certain number of skips. This is even better on iPad, where you can select any number of songs in any order and just sit through a 30 second ad every half hour - perfect for a casual user like me.

<a id="overcast"></a>

#### Overcast
Overcast is the best podcast player on iOS. I've written before about the advantages of Overcast, over the stock podcasts app on iOS, namely Smart Speed and Voice Boost. The app itself has had some more work on it in the past year and is a breeze to use.

<a id="youtube"></a>

#### Youtube
I really like the YouTube app on iOS. [Last year][yt16] I complained that the app doesn't have picture in picture, and that is still the case. I honestly don't see that changing any time soon, so I'm willing to accept that this might never be implemented - prove me wrong Google. Nonetheless, the YouTube app is really clean, easy to use and receives regular updates which is all you can ask for.

<a id="googlemaps"></a>

#### Google Maps
Still the king of maps in my book. Apple Maps is closing the gap bit by bit, but Google Maps is still my favourite. As long as Apple can make a good alternative to Google Maps, I'm sure they will be happy, but Google have long since set the benchmark here and I don't see any reason to stop using their service.

<a id="googletrips"></a>

#### Google Trips
Google Trips is a clever app in that it can detect based on your emails where and when you have booked a trip, and can offer you tips on where to eat, what to see and what to do in an area. It saves you the hassle of trawling through websites and books trying to plan out a trip, and bases all it's recommendations on actual reviews. For any travel enthusiast I'd highly recommend it. 

<a id="mytaxi"></a>

#### myTaxi
Uber don't operate in Ireland, so the next best thing is myTaxi (previously Hailo). It works just like Uber - set a location, pickup point and order. All payments can be made on card if necessary. It makes ordering taxis much easier and takes out the guesswork by letting you see where exactly your taxi is on a map in real time.

<a id="whatsapp"></a>

#### Whatsapp
Probably the most used app on my phone. The majority of my friends and family use Whatsapp, so I find myself spending a lot of time on it every day. The app is fast, well designed and rarely if ever causes me issues. It doesn't get in the way of me messaging people and keeps a backup of all my chats.
