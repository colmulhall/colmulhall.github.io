I enjoyed this review of the iPhone 7 on MacStories, particluarly the section on the [W1 chip][w1]. The iPhone 7 has brought about [changes][adiosjack] that we may not be in a perfect position to take advantage of just yet, but in the near future will become the norm. Federico Viticci hit the nail on the head with his closing paragraph:

>But using the iPhone 7 also made me appreciate the meaning of changes that will reshape the iPhone platform going forward â€“ something that's more significant than endlessly debating what we left behind.

>The iPhone 7 is a bold step towards a future we can start understanding today.
