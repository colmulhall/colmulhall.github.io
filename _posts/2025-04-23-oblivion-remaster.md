IGN's Ryan McCaffrey:

>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was the right game at the right time. By taking full advantage of HD televisions and expanding the scope and scale of what gamers could expect from an open-world game, it was a punch in the face to console gamers who, up to that point, had spent their entire gaming lives seeing their interactive worlds through an interlaced 640x480 television.

If there was ever to be a game remastered for modern hardware, I would have voted for Oblivion without question. I'm happy to report that in the few hours of the remaster that I have played, the magic is back.

And it looks amazing:
