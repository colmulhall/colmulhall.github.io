The latest episode of Under the Radar is worth a listen. [David Smith][underscore] talks about how his application '_Widgetsmith_' blew up in popularity when iOS 14 was released. Widgetsmith takes advantage of the new Widget feature of iOS 14, enabling users to customise their home screens. 

Within a few days it became the number one free app on the App Store worldwide, which is crazy when you consider it is developed by one guy. I'd like to hear more about the numbers behind it.
