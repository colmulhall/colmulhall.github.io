Nice idea from Instapaper. Their web parser must be really impressive. I very rarely come across a website that it can't parse for reading, and I save a *lot* of articles. Web design has moved on a lot in the last decade and the number of different languages and frameworks has grown to an almost comical [number][webweb], making this task harder and harder. When I was writing my final year project I wrote a fairly basic parser ([link][ppparse]) which targeted a small number of websites for news and information on the Phoenix Park in Dublin. The headaches I had trying to parse relevant information even from these relatively simple websites were..painful. It makes sense from Instapapers perspective and everyone elses if they don't have to write their own.
