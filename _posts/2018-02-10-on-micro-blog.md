Brent Simmons on Micro.blog: 

>Your posts are just a normal, everyday part of the open web. At this writing, mine appear on micro.inessential.com — but it’s on my to-do list to have those appear on my main blog (this blog) instead. (Probably won’t happen until after I ship the app I’m currently working on.)
>
>And this is how it used to be, and how it never should have stopped being: my blog is me on the web. I own my blog: I own me.
>
>And so everyone who follows me on Micro.blog sees my blog posts, and I see theirs. Simple.
>
>And anyone who wants to could just read my blog in an RSS reader instead. All good, all open.
