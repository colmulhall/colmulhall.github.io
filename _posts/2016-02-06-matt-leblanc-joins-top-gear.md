Now that we know that Clarkson, Hammond and May will have a new show on Amazon Prime, I was a lot less worried about who will take over Top Gear.

I wasn't very surprised when news broke that Chris Evans was to be the new host, but news that Matt LeBlanc has joined the team comes as a real surprise. 


Having seen him as a guest on Top Gear before it is clear that he is a big petrol head.  And of course we all know him as Joey from Friends. In theory he's the perfect person to add entertainment to a show which is as much known for it's car reviews as its humour. What's not to like?
