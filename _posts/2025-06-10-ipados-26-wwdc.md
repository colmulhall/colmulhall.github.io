>iPadOS 26 brings a new design; an entirely new powerful and intuitive windowing system; new features powered by Apple Intelligence; major enhancements to working with files, audio, and video; and more.

We're finally getting there. Proper multitasking, background tasks and file manager. 

My only hope is that developers are given the tools and incentive to making their apps take advantage of these features. 🤞🏻
