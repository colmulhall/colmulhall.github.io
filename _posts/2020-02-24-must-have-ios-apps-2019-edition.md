In keeping with [tradition][2018], here are my must have iOS apps that match Federicos.

<a id="overcast"></a>

#### Overcast
A daily podcast driver for me and an app that I rarely even notice I'm using with the advent of Siri Shortcuts. It's been rock solid since I started using it, and I've no intention of switching from it any time soon.

<a id="instagram"></a>

#### Instagram
I'm not a heavy user of Instagram, but I like the app and it's one of far too few that has embraced dark mode. Still waiting on iPad support though..

<a id="twitter"></a>

#### Twitter
Same as above. I'd imagine I'd have more complaints about it if I wrote more than one tweet a year.


<a id="whatsapp"></a>

#### WhatsApp
Even if I was lost in Antarctica I'd still be confident that I'd be able to send and receive WhatsApp messages. It's yet to let me down since I started using it.

<a id="1password"></a>

#### 1Password
I'm getting a strong sense of deja vu while writing these entries. The fact that 1Password is still on this list shows how good it is. If you aren't using a password manager yet then look no further.

<a id="netflix"></a>

#### Netflix
Netflix have gotten this app just right. The interface looks great and is easy to navigate. Progress syncs well between devices, and the ability to download makes it essential. Zero complaints.

<a id="youtube"></a>

#### YouTube
Much like the Netflix app, the YouTube app is solid. Picture in picture is something I would love, but I'm guessing Apple isn't too keen to give too much power to Google on that one..

<a id="maps"></a>

#### Google Maps
This needs no introduction. Still the king of navigation.
