It's unusual to see an update of this size coming to iOS at this time of the year, but it's a welcome one. There's been a lot of talk about Apple moving towards a different release schedule once iOS 10 gets shipped so it's realistic that we'll be seeing more of this kind of thing in the future.

The highlights of 9.3:

#### Night Shift

</div> 

This is Apple's attempt at creating (or copying) a screen brightness ..adjuster. Night Shift automatically changes the shade of your screen late in the evening to a warmer shade which is easier on the eyes and apparently improves sleep. The interesting thing is Apple [wouldn't allow][noflux] Flux onto the App Store back late last year. Flux has been around for a long time and offers pretty much the exact same service that Night Shift does. This could be coincidental, or Apple could have had a panic moment and decided to implement their own version. My guess is that it was long in the pipeline. Either way it's a welcome addition.

#### Notes
Notes has got a nice little update. You can now lock specific notes with a passcode or with Touch ID. I can think of a few scenarios where I would like to use this. I would like to see more of this though. Maybe the ability to lock message conversations or photo albums?

#### All The Rest
- News got an update, but we still don't have it in Ireland. 
- The Heath dashboard got an update. Looks nice, but I still haven't found much use for the app itself.
- Maps in CarPlay got a nice update.
- Some education features were added.
