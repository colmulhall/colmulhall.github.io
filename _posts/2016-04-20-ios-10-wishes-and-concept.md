Really good concept of what could be coming in iOS 10. My personal favourites are the advanced Control Center features, something which I have [wanted for a while][colmioctrlcent], and system wide dark mode. I use dark mode whenever available in apps, so to see this all over would be really great. On a related note, MacStories have [introduced a dark mode][msdark] on the site to mark their seven year anniversary. Some good work has gone into that site in the last few months.
