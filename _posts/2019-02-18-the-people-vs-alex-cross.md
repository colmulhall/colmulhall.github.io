Another in a [long list][crossbiblio] of Alex Cross stories. This time, detective Cross finds himself at the wrong side of the law as he tries to defend himself for the murder of followers of an old nemesis.

In the meantime, while suspended from his day job, he accompanies his former partner Sampson in another case that involves missing blonde women and the dark web.

I've read several Alex Cross books in the past and always find them entertaining. Chapters rarely go beyond four pages so there is always a sense of progress when reading them them. 

James Patterson is a master of keeping the suspense high, as he jumps between each different plot at a fast pace from chapter to chapter. Fans of fictional crime and easy reads will enjoy this book.

**Highlight**: The final few chapters where the perpetrators of the kidnappings are found.
