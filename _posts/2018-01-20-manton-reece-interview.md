Good interview with [Manton Reece][manton] on the motivations behind [Micro.blog][micro], which he created. I joined Micro.blog soon after it launched but have only recently started really using it on a regular basis. 

In comparison to an average Twitter timeline, Micro.blog is so much less cluttered, and more thought seems to go into posts. It's also a really great way to stumble across blogs from people that would otherwise be missed. 

I'm looking forward to future updates to the site. Hopefully it stays true to its [original intentions][microwhy].
