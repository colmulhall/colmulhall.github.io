I watched the first episode of ~~Top Gear~~ [The Grand Tour][gt] a few days ago. I'm not going to write a full review of the episode - I'll leave that to [others][caseytour] - but I will summarize my thoughts below:

#### The intro showed just how big the budget is for the show
Seriously, just watch the opening sequence.

#### The "Star in a reasonably priced car" segment looks like it's gone
Adios, you won't be missed.

#### The studio segments need work
I thought some sketches went on for far too long, and the presenters themselves seemed nervous. First episode nerves are to be expected though.

#### The 'tour' is a great idea
New episode, new location, new audience, new tracks, new cars. This almost guarantees that each epiosde will be unique and have it's own distict feel to it.

#### Chemistry is everything
I watch the show not for the car reviews, but for the presenters themselves. That is something that Top Gear now has a major challenge in replicating.
