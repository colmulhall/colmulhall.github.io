a developer in the telco industry, predominantly writing Java.

## About This Site

This site is where I write about things that interest me. On a technical side, the site is powered by 
[Casey Liss][liss]'s blogging engine "[Camel][cml]" and is hosted on [Heroku][hrku]. 
I use [Hover][hvr] for dealing with the domain. I have tweaked the appearance to my 
preference.

I use [Sublime Text][sbltxt] for any code tweaks. Posts are written in 
[Markdown][mrkd].
