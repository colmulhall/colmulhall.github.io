## About This Site

This site is where I write about things that interest me. 
On a technical side, the site is powered by [Jekyll][jek] and is hosted on GitHub Pages.
I use [Hover][hvr] for dealing with the domain. I have tweaked the appearance to my 
preference.

I use [Sublime Text][sbltxt] for any code tweaks. Posts are written in 
[Markdown][mrkd].
