I'm Colm, a software developer based in Ireland. 

In 2014 I graduated with a [degree in Computer Science][csdegree] from the 
Dublin Institute of Technology. I have been working as a software engineer since graduating.

This site is where I write about things that interest me. 
On a technical side, the site is powered by [Jekyll][jek] and is hosted on GitHub Pages.
I use [Hover][hvr] for dealing with the domain. I have tweaked the appearance to my 
preference.

I use [Sublime Text][sbltxt] for any code tweaks. Posts are written in 
[Markdown][mrkd].

Some [stats][stats].
